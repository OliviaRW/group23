Gus Kuster, 40, has been in and out of Australian jails for most of his adult life for drug and driving offences and was finally ready to walk free. But Mr Kuster is being forced to leave his family behind and move to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea where he will be forced to start his life over alone. Australian officials escorted the 40-year-old to Brisbane airport on Wednesday where he is set to board a one-way flight to Port Moresby and given two weeks accommodation and $250. Gus Kuster, 40, has been in and out of Australian prison for most of his adult life for drug and driving offences and was finally ready to walk free But Mr Kuster is being forced to leave his family behind and move to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea where he will be forced to start his life over alone (pictured with his mother) Mr Kuster was born to an Australian father, with three generations of family being citizens and no living family currently residing in Papua New Guinea. 'My great grandfather was born in New South Wales and fought in Gallipoli for Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'My grandfather was also born in NSW and fought World War II and my father is a white Australian.' The 40-year-old believes he should be a fourth generation Australian as his father, Richard, brought him to Australia to 'live as Australians'. But as his mother is from Papua New Guinea and he was born there, the government is refusing. 'How could this be? I came to Australia when I was three and I am now 40 years of age... I don't understand how they can say I'm not an Aussie,' he said. Mr Kuster will also have to leave behind his six-year-old son, who has no idea his father is being deported. Mr Kuster was born to an Australian father, with three generations of family being citizens and no living family currently residing in Papua New Guinea 'I have to leave behind my mother, father, all my nieces and nephews, my sisters, my whole life is being torn apart from this,' he said. 'My family is devastated... I am proud of my Papua New Guinea culture but even more proud of my Australian heritage'.   Mr Kuster is just one of thousands of permanent residents with criminal records the government has threatened to deport. In the past 20 years the 40-year-old has been behind bars ten times, with his worst offence resulting in a two-and-a-half year prison term in 2004 for dangerous driving during an amphetamine-fuelled police chase, ABC reported.   The government passed legislation allowing them to deport people with convictions but no jail time in July. Because Mr Kester never became an Australian citizen, that put him first in line to be told he had to leave the country. ","<h2>Criminal, 40, whose grandfather fought for Australia in World War II is to be deported to Papua New Guinea despite not living there since he was three years old</h2>"
1,7369067," Published: 16:24 BST, 18 August 2019 ","Steve Bullock, Montana governor and 2020 presidential candidate, on Sunday compared Ken Cuccinelli, the acting Director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said allowing the former Virginia attorney general to head Trump's immigration policy would be as bad a move as putting Putin in charge of the country's elections following evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential elections. 'I even served with Ken Cuccinelli when he was Attorney General. Like putting him in charge of immigration would be like putting Putin in charge of election security,' Bullock told Fox New Sunday. On Tuesday, Cuccinelli made a controversial statement when he amended the famous poem written on the Statue of Liberty when defending the administration's crack down on keeping immigrants on food stamps from obtaining green cards. Steve Bullock warned putting Ken Cuccinelli in charge of immigration policy is just as bad a move as putting Russian President Vladimir Putin in charge of election security 'I even served with Ken Cuccinelli when he was Attorney General. Like putting him in charge of immigration would be like putting Putin in charge of election security,' Bullock said Sunday When asked if the words 'give me your tired, your poor' still applied to those looking for a better life in America, Cuccinelli said 'certainly,' but amended the words. 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,' Cuccinelli told NPR of Emma Lazarus' poem, written on a plaque on the base of Lady Liberty. The Trump administration announced a new 'public charge' rule on Monday that would allow the government to bar entry into the country to any individual it feels would likely end up relying on Medicaid, food stamps or other public benefits. The rule, announced through the Department of Homeland Security, would also allow the government to deport immigrants and deny visa renewals for those utilizing these benefits. There has been widespread backlash from immigration advocacy groups following the announcement and some states, like California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Maines, are even suing the administration to try and block the rule.  Cuccinelli, the acting Director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services amended the words on the Statue of Liberty to say: 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,' when defending a new administration rule on immigration Emma Lazarus's sonnet 'The New Colossus' rests inside the base of the Statue of Liberty and reads, in one portion, 'Give me your tired, your poor' The Trump administration announced a new rule Monday deeming the U.S. can deny migrants entry if it feels they would likely end up relying on Medicaid, food stamps or other public benefits 'What I disagree with is, we're using immigration to essentially divide this country,' Bullock, a long shot candidate who earns an average of 0.5 per cent support, said. The candidate did not explicitly say that he disagreed with the reasoning that led to the 'public charge' rule. 'The idea, I think, behind it is to turn around and say that everyone that comes to this country with documentation wants to make sure that they can succeed and live that American dream,' Bullock said Sunday morning. Cuccinelli argued it;s a 'privilege' for migrants to be granted American citizenship and that 'privilege' entails financial independence. 'We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American,' he said in his interview with NPR this week. 'It is a privilege to become an American – not a right for anybody who is not already an American citizen,' he added.  White House adviser Stephen Miller, who oversees immigration policy, also downplayed the poem, citing that it was added to the Statue of Liberty and was not part of the original structure The Lazarus poem was written in 1883 to help raise funds for the statue's base Cuccinelli was appointed as acting Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in June, but before that was the attorney general in Virginia.  Bullock served as the Montana attorney general around the same time Cuccinelli was serving in Virginia. White House adviser Stephen Miller, who oversees immigration policy for the president, also invoked the Statue of Liberty and down played the words in the poem during an August 2018 exchange with reporters. 'I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you're referring to was added later and is not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty,' he said. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886 with Lazarus' poem added 17 years later. She wrote the sonnet in 1883 to raise funds for the statue's pedestal.",<h2>2020 hopeful Steve Bullock says Ken Cuccinelli heading immigration policy is just as bad as putting Vladimir Putin in charge of election security</h2>
2,7368793," Published: 13:56 BST, 18 August 2019 ","The head of U.S. immigration and border patrol has hit back at Google employees who are petitioning for the tech giant to stop working with them over human rights violations.   'That kind of rhetoric frustrating. It's absolutely irresponsible, it's misinformed, it's not factual and a lot of it is just straight out lies.' U.S Border and Custom Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said Saturday of the petition.  Morgan visited a detention facility in El Paso, Texas, Thursday and told Fox & Friends: 'Let me tell the American people what the truth is. I just returned from El Paso...and what the truth is ... they're going to see that these families and children are receiving hot meals. 'You're going to see children set in front of flat-screen TV's, watching cartoons. They're getting medical attention. That's the truth. This kind of rhetoric is irresponsible, reckless and a lie.'  U.S Border and Custom Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan called Google employees'  petition to stop working with ICE irresponsible, reckless and a lie Wednesday's petition compares assisting border enforcement to aiding the Nazis in the Holocaust Morgan's remarks came in response to an angry petition made public Wednesday by Google employees that demanded that the company not provide any services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement.  At least 950 Google employees signed the petition demanding that the tech giant publicly commit to refuse any contracts with the immigration and border enforcement agencies.  'We demand that Google publicly commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses,' the petition read. 'We refuse to be complicit. It is unconscionable that Google, or any other tech company, would support agencies engaged in caging and torturing vulnerable people,' it continued. A Google spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com  Google is a major cloud computing provider, with competitors including Amazon and Microsoft, and has sought to expand its government contacts in recent years.   The petition cites reports that CBP is preparing to request bids on a massive cloud computing contract, and goes on to demand that Google not participate in the bidding. It also compares assisting border enforcement agencies to 'working with the Nazis during the Holocaust.' Morgan (left) visited a detention facility in El Paso, Texas, Thursday and said 'These families and children are receiving hot meals. That's the truth' A petition signed by at least 950 Google employees demands the company refuse to provide any services to ICE and Border Patrol The petition claims that ICE and CBP are in 'grave violation of international human rights law' and that working with those agencies would threaten Google's 'diverse, inclusive, and psychologically safe workplace.' Critics of the Trump administration have lambasted unsanitary and crowded conditions in facilities used to detain and process people who cross the border illegally. The administration's defenders say that the system is overwhelmed by a massive influx of illegal migrants, and that agencies are coping as best they can within limited budgets.  Last month, CBP reported more than 82,000 people crossed the border illegally or were deemed inadmissible at ports of entry, more than double the number from the same period a year ago.  A chart shows border apprehensions for this year in red, as well as for the past five years Google is not the first company to face similar demands from employees. Last month, Amazon employees were in revolt over their company's sale of services to a data mining company that works with ICE. An internal email circulated at Amazon demanding Amazon drop Palantir as an Amazon Web Services customer. It is also the latest in a long line of employee protests at Google, which a recent report indicated is being increasingly held hostage by its 'woke' workforce.  Google last year dropped out of the bidding for a huge Pentagon cloud computing contract that could be worth up to $10 billion after a protest by employees urging the company to stay out of the business of war. Google employees have also challenged the company on issues including sexual harassment in the workplace and the potential tailoring of a version of its online search engine for use on China's heavily censored internet. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is currently engaged in human rights abuses at the US Southern border. Together with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is presently responsible for the housing of migrant children, they are caging and harming asylum seekers, separating children from parents, illegally detaining refugees and US citizens, and perpetrating a system of abuse and malign neglect that has led to the deaths of at least 7 children in detention camps. These abuses are illegal under international human rights law, and immoral by any standard. In January of 2017 thousands of Googlers, including our executives, joined together to protest the Trump administration's Muslim Ban. This was the right thing to do and we are proud to work at a place that reflects these values. It has recently come to light that CBP is gearing up to request bids on a massive cloud computing contract. The winning cloud provider will be streamlining CBP's infrastructure and facilitating its human rights abuses. It's time to stand together again and state clearly that we will not work on any such contract. We demand that Google publicly commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses. Google has repeatedly advertised its commitments to implementing ethical guardrails on its tech. Google's AI Principles state that Google will not build technologies 'whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.' By any interpretation, CBP and ICE are in grave violation of international human rights law. The company has also pledged to create a diverse, inclusive, and psychologically safe workplace for all its workers, including immigrants and Latinx people — the very populations whose communities, families, and friends are being terrorized by CBP and ICE. In working with CBP, ICE, or ORR, Google would be trading its integrity for a bit of profit, and joining a shameful lineage. We have only to look to IBM's role working with the Nazis during the Holocaust to understand the role that technology can play in automating mass atrocity. History is clear: the time to say NO is now. We refuse to be complicit. It is unconscionable that Google, or any other tech company, would support agencies engaged in caging and torturing vulnerable people. And we are not alone — the world is watching and the facts are clear. We stand with workers and advocates across the industry who are demanding that the tech industry refuse to provide the infrastructure for mass atrocity.

3,7368007," Published: 03:02 BST, 18 August 2019 ","Honduran national Oscar Pacheco-Leonardo, 33, was arrested in North Carolina on June 14 and charged with rape and indecent liberties with a child. He was released two days after posting a $100,000 bond US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has blasted a North Carolina sheriff's office for releasing a Honduran illegal immigrant accused of child rape and other charges instead of honoring an ICE detainer notice. Oscar Pacheco-Leonardo, 33, a Honduran national and fugitive, was arrested during a 'targeted enforcement operation' in North Carolina's Mecklenburg County on August 9, according to an ICE media alert Friday.  Pacheco-Leonardo's arrest, ICE officials noted, came 'nearly two months after the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office refused to honor an ICE detainer, or even notify ICE of the release, and instead released Mr. Pacheco’s from local criminal custody following his arrest on first-degree rape and indecent liberties with a minor charges.' ICE went on to note that 'by releasing a previously deported alien facing serious criminal charges, Mecklenburg County chose to release a serious public safety threat onto the streets of Charlotte where he was free to potentially harm others for nearly two months until his capture by ICE.'   Pacheco-Leonardo was initially arrested by local police on June 14 on charges of First Degree Rape and two counts of Indecent Liberties with a Child.  Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said in a statement obtained by Fox 46 that Pacheco-Leonardo was released from jail on June 16 after he fulfilled his court-ordered terms and conditions of release, including paying his $100,000 bond.   'Setting bond amounts and conditions of release are the responsibility of Mecklenburg County, Judges and Magistrates. MCSO has a responsibility to abide by such court orders,' the sheriff said Friday.    ICE revealed that it had arrested fugitive Pacheco-Leonardo on August 9, almost two months later, slamming the sheriff's department that originally released him  Pacheco-Leondaro's arrest record showing his charges and dates of arrest and release Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden (left) said ICE knew his department didn't honor ICE detainers and should've issued a criminal arrest warrant for Pacheco-Leonardo. ICE official Sean Gallagher (right) said the detainer refusal implies the county is a safe haven for criminals North Carolina House Speaker Rep. Tim Moore tweeted there would be a vote next week on House Bill 370 which would force law enforcement to comply with ICE detainer requests He went on to note that the sheriff's department does not honor voluntary ICE administrative detainers.  According to ICE, the detainers allow law enforcement agencies to hold on to people who are not legally in the US for an additional 48 hours 'so that ICE may assume custody for removal purposes' and are issued 'when the agency possesses probable cause to believe an alien is removable from the United States.'  McFadden said that when Pacheco-Leonardo was arrested in June, the sheriff's office was unaware that he had been previously deported in July 2006, because ICE had not informed them of this fact, despite that information being 'readily available' to the agency. McFadden added that 'it is a federal felony to re-enter the United States after having been previously deported.'  When the sheriff's office notified ICE that it had arrested Pacheco-Leonardo on the rape and indecent liberties with a child charges, McFadden said ICE opted to issue the voluntary ICE administrative detainer for him instead of a criminal arrest warrant for 'Illegal Re-Entry.' This, despite 'knowing that it is against MCSO's policy to honor such detainers.'  'The reasons for that decision have yet to be satisfactorily explained to me or the public,' McFadden said.     In the ICE media alert, the department revealed 22 other cases over the last nine months during which the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office had released foreign nationals in the US illegally, instead of honoring ICE's detainer requests.  ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Atlanta Field Office Director Sean Gallagher said in a statement obtained by WBTV that Pacheco-Leonardo's case 'is yet another example of a clear public safety threat being released onto the streets of Mecklenburg County rather than into ICE custody due to the current sheriff’s policy on ICE non-cooperation.' He went on to say that 'Mecklenburg County sheriff’s decision to restrict cooperation with ICE serves as an open invitation to aliens who commit criminal offenses that Mecklenburg County is a safe haven for persons seeking to evade federal authorities, and residents of Mecklenburg County are less safe today than last year due these policies.' In response to this immigration detainer argument, Republican North Carolina House Speaker Rep. Tim Moore tweeted 'The North Carolina House will vote on H.B. 370 Require Sheriff Cooperation with ICE Detainers - a bill supported by the N.C. Sheriffs' Association - as early as next week to end this outrageous refusal to protect the public from wanted criminals.'  House Bill 370 would force law enforcement agencies to carry out ICE detainers.",<h2>ICE officials slam a North Carolina sheriff who released on bond a previously-deported illegal immigrant accused of child rape because the sheriff's office chose to ignore a detainer request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement</h2>

6,7364003," Published: 14:18 BST, 16 August 2019 ","Capt Thomas Woodworth (pictured) at a Rhode Island prison on Friday resigned after a video emerged showing a truck driving at anti-ICE protesters on Wednesday A correction captain at a Rhode Island prison on Friday resigned after allegedly driving a truck at a group protesting federal immigration policies in an incident that was caught on video. A spokesman for the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility said in a brief statement that Capt. Thomas Woodworth stepped down from his post a day being placed on administrative leave. Wednesday's incident is currently the subject of two separate investigations.     Organizers of the anti-ICE protest say at least two demonstrators were injured when a pickup truck moved through a crowd of people who were blocking an entrance to the facility that houses nearly 130 ICE detainees.  One of the victims, 64-year-old Jerry Belair, reportedly suffered a broken leg, internal bleeding and a possible back injury.  Daniel Martin, the warden of the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, did not specifically say Woodworth, 53, was the driver, and Wyatt spokesman Chris Hunter says the internal investigation will address that and other facts.  Rhode Island State Police and the attorney general’s office also are investigating. Martin’s statement Thursday says his facility supports the First Amendment right of citizens to peacefully protest on public property.   Shocking footage shows a man believed to be a correctional officer driving into a group of anti-ICE protesters who were sitting outside a detention facility in Rhode Island The 40-50 protesters were sitting on the pavement to block staff from parking at Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility, which works with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), when a black pickup truck barreled towards them at about 10pm.  The driver then went straight through crowd as people screamed in the background and jumped onto the back of the vehicle in an attempt to stop it. Corrections officers subsequently came running outside and asked people to back away from the vehicle.  They then began pepper spraying protesters, including a reporter with WLNE. A spokesman for Never Again Action told DailyMail.com that five people taken to the hospital, two with injuries related to the truck and three who were treated for the effects of pepper spray. The spokesman added: 'The driver called for backup on a handheld walkie talkie and was wearing the Captain’s version of the uniform the other guards were wearing, and he was driving to the employee parking lot.'  Capt Woodworth, who lives in Connecticut with his family, according to Heavy.com, previously worked as a correctional officer for the state of Connecticut Department of Corrections and in 2007 was named in a federal lawsuit filed by an inmate at the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center alleging excessive force.  The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed and Woodworth left the Connecticut DOC in 2010.   Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, expressed her 'outrage' that a peaceful protest against immigration policies at the Wyatt Detention Center was interrupted and people were hurt. She said she had contacted the State Police Commander and both were committed to a 'full investigation'  of the events. She said: 'I share the outrage Rhode Islanders are feeling about the incident depicted in the video at the Wyatt Detention Center. 'Our state and our nation were built on the idea that everyone has a right to express their opinion publicly and peacefully.'  'President Trump’s immigration policies are immoral, and these Rhode Islanders were exercising their constitutional right to protest,' the governor added. It was reported that 600 people from Never Again Action attended the protest on Wednesday The car can be seen creeping slowly towards the protesters outside the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility People are heard screaming in the background as the pick-up truck barrels towards them  James Diossa, the Mayor of Rhode Island said he spoke to Attorney General Peter Neronha and Colonel James M. Manni who will conduct an investigation into the incident.

7,7361745," Published: 21:50 BST, 15 August 2019 ","Google employees have demanded that the company not provide any services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. In an angry petition made public on Wednesday, the employees demanded that the tech giant publicly commit to refuse any contracts with the immigration and border enforcement agencies.  'We demand that Google publicly commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses,' the petition read. 'We refuse to be complicit. It is unconscionable that Google, or any other tech company, would support agencies engaged in caging and torturing vulnerable people,' it continued. Google employees are seen protesting the Trump administration's travel ban in 2017. Hundreds have now signed a petition demanding that the company not work with CBP A Google spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com  Google is a major cloud computing provider, with competitors including Amazon and Microsoft, and has sought to expand its government contacts in recent years.   The petition cites reports that CBP is preparing to request bids on a massive cloud computing contract, and goes on to demand that Google not participate in the bidding. It also compares assisting border enforcement agencies to 'working with the Nazis during the Holocaust.' The petition claims that ICE and CBP are in 'grave violation of international human rights law' and that working with those agencies would threaten Google's 'diverse, inclusive, and psychologically safe workplace.' Critics of the Trump administration have lambasted unsanitary and crowded conditions in facilities used to detain and process people who cross the border illegally. The administration's defenders say that the system is overwhelmed by a massive influx of illegal migrants, and that agencies are coping as best they can within limited budgets.   In this file photo taken on March 20, 2019 a group of about 30 Brazilian migrants, who had just crossed the border illegally, sit on the ground near US Border Patrol agents in New Mexico A chart shows border apprehensions for this year in red, as well as for the past five years Last month, CBP reported more than 82,000 people crossed the border illegally or were deemed inadmissible at ports of entry, more than double the number from the same period a year ago. Google is not the first company to face similar demands from employees. Last month, Amazon employees were in revolt over their company's sale of services to a data mining company that works with ICE. An internal email circulated at Amazon demanding Amazon drop Palantir as an Amazon Web Services customer. It is also the latest in a long line of employee protests at Google, which a recent report indicated is being increasingly held hostage by its 'woke' workforce.  Google last year dropped out of the bidding for a huge Pentagon cloud computing contract that could be worth up to $10 billion after a protest by employees urging the company to stay out of the business of war. Google employees have also challenged the company on issues including sexual harassment in the workplace and the potential tailoring of a version of its online search engine for use on China's heavily censored internet. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is currently engaged in human rights abuses at the US Southern border. Together with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is presently responsible for the housing of migrant children, they are caging and harming asylum seekers, separating children from parents, illegally detaining refugees and US citizens, and perpetrating a system of abuse and malign neglect that has led to the deaths of at least 7 children in detention camps. These abuses are illegal under international human rights law, and immoral by any standard. In January of 2017 thousands of Googlers, including our executives, joined together to protest the Trump administration's Muslim Ban. This was the right thing to do and we are proud to work at a place that reflects these values. It has recently come to light that CBP is gearing up to request bids on a massive cloud computing contract. The winning cloud provider will be streamlining CBP's infrastructure and facilitating its human rights abuses. It's time to stand together again and state clearly that we will not work on any such contract. We demand that Google publicly commit not to support CBP, ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human rights abuses. Google has repeatedly advertised its commitments to implementing ethical guardrails on its tech. Google's AI Principles state that Google will not build technologies 'whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.' By any interpretation, CBP and ICE are in grave violation of international human rights law. The company has also pledged to create a diverse, inclusive, and psychologically safe workplace for all its workers, including immigrants and Latinx people — the very populations whose communities, families, and friends are being terrorized by CBP and ICE. In working with CBP, ICE, or ORR, Google would be trading its integrity for a bit of profit, and joining a shameful lineage. We have only to look to IBM's role working with the Nazis during the Holocaust to understand the role that technology can play in automating mass atrocity. History is clear: the time to say NO is now. We refuse to be complicit. It is unconscionable that Google, or any other tech company, would support agencies engaged in caging and torturing vulnerable people. And we are not alone — the world is watching and the facts are clear. We stand with workers and advocates across the industry who are demanding that the tech industry refuse to provide the infrastructure for mass atrocity.

9,7358761," Published: 05:19 BST, 15 August 2019 ","Ilhan Omar has slammed controversial Republican congressman Steve King's claims that there would be no population left if not for 'rape and incest', while simultaneously bashing her GOP critics.   'Gross! This would explain why these weirdos are fixed on smearing me with claims of incest. Projecting their filth, unreal,' she tweeted Wednesday in response to King's remarks.  The 'filth' the Democratic congresswoman is alluding to are allegations that she married her brother in order to fraud immigration - one that has been peddled by many of her adversaries, including president Donald Trump.  'There's a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it,' Trump told reporters in June.  Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar responded to Rep Steve King's incest remarks via Twitter on Wednesday The 'filth' the Democratic congresswoman is alluding to are allegations that she married her brother in order to fraud immigration  Omar's personal life has come under a microscope with questions concerning her second marriage to Ahmed Elmi, after multiple reports identified him as her brother.  She had previously been married in the Islamic faith to Ahmed Hirsi, but the marriage was never formalized. She had two children with him before they supposedly split shortly before she married Elmi. However records suggest that Omar, Elmi and Hirsi all lived together for a while and by marrying Omar, Elmi, now 34, was allowed to enter the United States and attend North Dakota State. They are said to have split after a couple of years but Omar waited until 2017 to divorce him and in the meantime she got back with Hirsi and had a third child in 2012.    But her second marriage to Hirsi was short-lived — as DailyMail.com reported exclusively last month she has now moved out of the family home and into a penthouse apartment in the trendy Mill District of Minneapolis.  Omar has consistently refused to talk in detail about her marriage to Elmi until alluding to it today in her tweet condemning King.  Omar's private life has become the subject of massive speculation amid accusations that her second husband Ahmed Nur Said Elmi  right) is in fact her brother and she only married him to get him entry to the United States   Omar had recently split with her husband Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her three children King told a conservative crowd at an event in a suburb of Des Moines, 'What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? 'Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't certify that I was not a part of a product of that,' he stated at the Iowa event. The Des Moines Register reports that the Republican added, 'It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother.' And Omar was not the only politician to hit out at King's disturbing remarks.  His comments were quickly condemned by Democrat J.D. Scholten, who's vying for his seat in the House of Representatives, presidential candidates campaigning in Iowa and the House Republican Conference chairwoman. And nearly every 2020 presidential candidate followed suit, lambasting King and fishing for contributions for Scholten.  Appearing on CNN, Kamala Harris burst into laughter after a clip of King making the offending remarks and then speculating that he's likely a product of rape and incest played out.  'These guys are just out of their minds. Like, what is that?' she said of King, Donald Trump and the Republicans' rhetoric. 'What is going on with these people?'   GOP leader Liz Cheney was one of the few Republicans to speak out against King in the immediate aftermath of his remarks.  'Today’s comments by [Steve King] are appalling and bizarre. As I’ve said before, it’s time for him to go. The people of Iowa’s 4th congressional district deserve better,' she said.

In an interview on 'Special Report' on Fox News, he said, 'I have a great deal of problems with that. This isn’t the first time I’ve had concerns of what Steve King has said. Earlier in this Congress, there are things that Steve King said that I do not believe the party of Lincoln would stand for.  'We actually removed Steve King from his committees inside Congress, and I think this just continues to show why that action was taken,' he said. King's remarks are the latest in a long line of controversies which have made the Republican a virtual outcast from his own party. He announced in February that he would seek a 10th term, in spite of comments he made on 'white nationalism' that he claims were taken out of context.  'I am running in 2020,' he said at the time and added that: 'I have nothing to apologize for.'  Trump will be on top of the ticket in the upcoming election, and it's unclear what kind of help he'll give King, who must first defeat three Republican primary challengers to win the nomination.   ",<h2>Ilhan Omar responds to Rep Steve King's incest remarks by slamming GOP 'weirdos' for 'projecting their filth' with claims that she married her brother</h2>
10,7357241," Published: 19:07 BST, 14 August 2019 ","An undocumented immigrant who spent three months in a cell after he recited a poem criticizing US immigration policies was released from a detention center Monday thanks to two NFL players who helped cover his bail.  José Bello, a 22-year-old California college student, attended a board of supervisors meeting in Kern County in May and slammed the government and the immigration agency for its practices while reading a poem he wrote, 'Dear America.'   The Bakersfield College student, who at the time of his arrest was also working at a farm, penned a poem that in part read: 'I speak for the victims that pay for this scam: Vietnamese, Jamaican, African, Cambodian, Mexican, Salvadoran, on and on, together we stand.  'We demand our respect. We want our dignity back. Our roots run deep in this country, now that's a true fact. 'I'm here to let you know, we want to feel safe — whether we're Brown, Asian, or Black. We don't want your jobs. We don't want your money. We're here to work hard, pay taxes, and study.' José Bello was released from an ICE detention center in California. He criticized the U.S. immigration policies and the immigration agency itself by reading a poem at a Kern County board meeting in May Bello (pictured), a 22-year-old college student and farm worker, was released from an ICE detention center Monday after two NFL players came forward and helped cover his $50,000 bail payment Norman (left) and Davis (right) joined the New York Immigrant Freedom Fund and the National Bail Network Fund in covering the cost of Bello's bail ICE agents showed up at his Bakersfield home the morning of May 15 and arrested him - 36 hours after he read the poem. A $50,000 bail was imposed by ICE, a large amount considering that Bello, the father of a little boy, was earning close to $20,000 a year.  Bello has been living in the United States after arriving from Mexico as a three-year-old.  Word of Bello's uphill battle to get out of jail reached Josh Norman, of the Washington Redskins, and Demario Davis, of the New Orleans Saints, both of whom are actively working to eliminate the cash bail system. Norman and Davis joined the New York Immigrant Freedom Fund and the National Bail Network Fund in covering the cost of Bello's bail, which allowed him to walk out of the Mesa Verde Detention Center on Monday afternoon. 'Jose Bello was exercising a fundamental right that we pride ourselves on as Americans,' Norman said in a joint statement with the ACLU. 'If he was detained for reciting a peaceful poem then we should really ask ourselves, are our words truly free? This is America right? Where the 1st Amendment is freedom of speech unless I missed the memo somewhere. He was exercising that right.' Norman and Davis are members of the Players Coalition, formed in 2017 by former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin and Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcom Jenkins to seek social justice and racial equality.  José Bello (second from right) was unable to post a $50,000 bail bond and spent nearly three months in jail after ICE arrested the undocumented immigrant in May, just two days after he slammed the agency and the government for its anti-immigration policies Josh Norman (pictured) questioned whether people are protected by the First Amendment after José Bello landed in jail just days after taking the government and ICE to task over immigration policies. 'If he (José Bello) was detained for reciting a peaceful poem then we should really ask ourselves, are our words truly free,' Norman said  Demario Davis is one of two NFL players who covered an undocumented immigrant's bail 'Josh and I wanted to do something symbolic to show people know there's something they can do to help,' Davis told NFL.com.  'With a lot of these cases, people can't afford to post bail. So you have things like in Mississippi, where [680] people were rounded up by ICE, and a lot of kids went to school that day and came home and their parents were gone. Everybody knows that's a messed-up situation, and they wonder what they can do. Well, you can donate to these national organizations that are providing funds to help with bail for these people.  'That way, at least they have time to be with their families, get a lawyer and get set up, versus being in a situation where nobody is telling them what's happening with their kids or with their own situation. It's inhumane to take parents from their children and not tell them what's going on with their kids. That's just something that you would not expect to be happening here in America.' It wasn't the first time Bello had crossed paths with ICE. Agents first nabbed Bello in May 2018, and alleged he he was a member of a local street gang, but he was later freed in August when a federal immigration set his bail at $10,000 bond.  In January, the farm worker was again apprehended for driving under the influence but was not detained.  The ACLU Southern California chapter's attempt to have Bello released or have his $50,000 bail reduced was turned down by a federal judge in San Francisco who rejected a First Amendment lawsuit.

We don’t want your money.  We’re here to work hard, pay taxes, and study.  The fight has begun.  “We will never be apart, chiquito,” is what I promised my son.  Y’all can try to justify your actions, try to make excuses.  The bottom line here is that, at the end, the people always triumph, and the government loses.  Dear America,  Do not consider this a threat: Our intentions are to keep making America Great.  It’s time to begin standing up for what’s right:  Criminalizing children, separating our families—our “national security,” does this make it alright? No. It doesn’t, and it won’t.  The youth have to stand up.  We have to unite with our peers.  Let’s begin educating our children, speak wisdom into their ears.  Because at the end of the day, I am you, and you are me.  Together, we are.  ","<h2>NFL players help pay $50,000 cash bail of undocumented immigrant who spent 89 days in an ICE detention center after reciting 'Dear America' poem that blasted US immigration policies at city board meeting</h2>"

No one was injured in the attacks.   'We had federal employees who were present, who although they were not hit by the rounds fired, by the grace of God. Had the bullets gone 2 inches in another direction, we could be here today talking about the murder of a federal official,' said FBI special agent Christopher Combs at a press conference. 'I don't think there's a question that they knew which floors the ice offices were,' he said, calling it a 'very targeted attack.' He called the shootings 'cowardly, brazen, violent acts, absolutely without justification.'  ICE blamed 'political rhetoric and misinformation' from the media for the incident. 'Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts,' the agency said in a statement. 'ICE officers put their lives on the line each and every day to keep our communities safe,' the statement read.

'It can be dangerous and it can result in people taking action that are not supported by facts that are not in response to anything inappropriate that the men and women of ICE are doing and we've got to tone that down.'  Each side blames the other for the escalation. ICE supporters claim the rage is fueled by congressional Democrats, members of the media and the 2020 presidential hopefuls.  Democrats, however, blame President Trump for inciting white supremacists with his rhetoric.  Meanwhile, the conservative news website Breitbart showed footage protesters in Florida from Democratic-leaning groups threatening workers and former employees of the GEO Group, a private contractor used by ICE.  Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan called on people to tone down 'dangerous' rhetoric  One protester threatened the family the company's former general counsel, John Bulfin.

Main Street and Charleston Boulevard in downtown Las Vegas The artwork has sparked debate on social media on the same day Donald Trump's immigration chief amended the words of the famous poem on the Statue of Liberty to include the, 'poor who can stand on their own two feet.' In 1903, a bronze tablet with the text of Emma Lazarus's sonnet 'The New Colossus' - which she had written 20 years earlier - was presented by friends of the poet to be added to the Statute of Liberty. It was originally mounted inside the pedestal but today resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum in the base.  During an NPR interview, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, was asked if the words from Emma Lazarus' poem - 'give me your tired, your poor' - were still part of 'the American ethos.' 'They certainly,' he responded before changing the words to, 'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.'  Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli is defending the new, 'public charge,' rule after it came under fire from immigration advocates Emma Lazarus's sonnet, 'The New Colossus,' rests inside the base of the Statue of Liberty The Lazarus poem was written in 1883 to help raise funds for the statue's base Zevalking said he painted the mural to, 'draw analogies with America's past and how it was founded and how it was largely built by immigrants' Cuccinelli is not the first Trump administration official to put their own spin on the famous words from Lazarus' poem. White House adviser Stephen Miller, who oversees immigration policy for the president, down played them in an August 2018 exchange with reporters. 'I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American liberty lighting the world. The poem that you're referring to was added later and is not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty,' he said. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886 with Lazarus' poem added 17 years later.  She wrote the sonnet in 1883 to raise funds for the statue's pedestal. Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. ""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" Trump defended his new policy before he left for an event in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.  'I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer, it's about Americans first, it's not fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States,' he told reporters in New Jersey where he is spending a few weeks at his Trump National Golf Course Bedminister.  'I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go on to welfare and various other things,' the president added. 'I think we're doing it right.' Cuccinelli, in his NPR interview, was defending the president's the new 'public charge' rule that was announced on Monday.  It has come under fire from immigration advocacy groups and is facing lawsuits from state attorneys general.  Cuccinelli argued it is a, 'privilege,' for a migrant to be granted American citizenship and that, 'privilege,' entails financial independence.  'We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American,' he said.   'It is a privilege to become an American – not a right for anybody who is not already an American citizen,' he added. Cuccinelli argued anyone who wants to become a citizen should be able to support themselves and not to have to avail themselves of government services, which are free to U.S. citizens. White House adviser Stephen Miller, who oversees immigration policy, has long pushed for the rule 'That privilege starts with certain expectations and for the last 140 years among those expectations is that the people who come here will not become a burden on the tax payers or the government. Again that doesn't seem too much to ask as we open our doors currently to more than 1 million new people a year: that they not become a burden on an already, frankly, over-burdened and bankrupt welfare system,' he told NPR. Cuccinelli announced on Monday the administration will crack down on green cards for immigrants who've spent more than a year on food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits designated for low-income residents. That new 'public charge' rule essentially implements a wealth test for those seeking citizenship to ensure immigrants have the financial means to support themselves. When asked by NPR what immigrants are welcome to the country, Cuccinelli responded: 'All immigrants who can stand on their own two feet, self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their boot straps – as in the American tradition.'    Cuccinelli rewrote the words to the poem on the Statue of Liberty as he defended the president's new immigration rule He said immigrants who use legal government services - such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and most forms of Medicaid - will have that counted against them in their application for a green card.  'If they don't have future prospects of being legal permanent residents without welfare that will be counted against them, yes. And that is the point of the rule. It doesn't seem too much to ask that we have Americans here who aren't likely to go on welfare and become the historic term 'public charge.' This is part of President Trump keeping his promises. This is not new or surprise,' he said. But, he clarified, since the new rule goes into effect October 15 and only applies going forward, no one will be surprised by it. 'People will not be surprised backwards in time,' he said. Meanwhile, two states are already planning lawsuits against the administration. New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday she is suing Trump over his new immigration crack down as it will make 'children go hungry.'  'President Trump's new public charge rule is yet one more example of his Administration turning its back on people fighting to make a better life for them and their families. Under this rule, children will go hungry; families will go without medical care. I am committed to defending all of New York's communities, which is why I intend to sue the Trump Administration over this egregious rule,' James said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.   And California Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to 'take legal action' against Trump's new 'public charge' rule.  'This vile rule is the Trump Administration's latest attack on families and lower income communities of color,' he said in a statement. 'It will harm our communities, schools, and workplaces by weaponizing essential healthcare, housing, and nutrition programs. We will not stand idly by while this Administration targets programs that children and families across our state rely upon. We are ready to take legal action to protect the rights of all Californians.' New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra have announced legal action against the Trump administration A 'public charge' typically refers to someone who is 'primarily dependent on the government for subsistence' based on their receipt of 'public cash assistance.'   Trump's new rule, set to go into effect October 15, expands the designation to include those receiving food stamps, housing assistance and/or Medicaid as a negative factor when being evaluated for a green card.  Immigration advocacy groups slammed the new rule.  'This policy denies a permanent, secure future in this country to anyone who isn't white and wealthy,' said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, in a statement. And there were concerns it would keep immigrants from seeking necessary medical care. 'This final rule serves to further intimidate and frighten families who seek needed services to keep them healthy and productive. Taken together with other looming harmful proposals, these actions will have detrimental consequences on immigrant health and well-being,' said Dr. Julie Linton, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Immigrant Child and Family Health, in a statement.    Cuccinelli said Monday at a briefing at the White House that any 'individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period' will not be eligible for a green card.  'Our rule generally prevents aliens who are likely to become a public charge from coming to the United States or remaining here and getting a green card,' he stated.  Low-income migrants living in America who want to become U.S. citizens will face additional hurdles after Oct. 15.    Anyone who has spent a year on food stamp, Medicaid or some other public benefit designed for the needy, is all but certain to be denied a green card.  The rule will state that any 'individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period' will not be eligible to remain in the United States permanently. Individuals who take two public benefits will see that time cut in half.  Anyone taking advantage of three government resources that are now restricted must essentially quit the services for three years to be considered for a green card. Refugees and asylums seekers will not not be affected, nor will human and sex trafficking victims.  An exemption for members of the military and their spouses will also be made.  Participants in the National School Lunch Program or The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are left alone. Medical assistance, disaster relief, homeless shelters and Head Start are not counted as public benefits. It does not include benefits for children and pregnant women like the National School Lunch Program or The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Cuccinelli said. Medical assistance, disaster relief, homeless shelters and Head Start also are not part of the rule, which has long been a priority for Miller.  Age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills will all be assessed in the application process, Cuccinelli said. 'No one factor alone will decide an applicant's case,' he said of the green cards. Additionally, migrants that do not meet the qualifications will have the option to adjust their status to that of a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) through the purchase of a public charge bond that the government plans to sell for a minimum of $8,100 a person, and possibly more, depending on the individual's circumstances. Cuccinelli insisted that the new rule will 'help promote immigrant success' and 'self-sufficiency' of immigrants seeking to become Americans. It's that same 'hard-working spirit' that's made the U.S. a beacon, he claimed. Refugees and asylums seekers will not not be affected, nor will human and sex trafficking victims. An exemption for members of the military and their spouses will also be made.   The administration first signaled that it would seek to adjust the legal definition of a 'public charge' in September 2018 to make the standards for citizenship more rigorous than they had been.      'Congress has never defined the charge public charge in the law,' Cuccinelli said Monday. 'Well that is what changes today with this rule.'  He announced, 'Through the public charge rule, President Trump's administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. Ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and becoming successful in America.'  A White House fact sheet revealed that the administration also plans to use the new rule to keep migrants from ever stepping foot in the country, if the administration decides they're too risky, based on the updated guidance. 'Aliens will be barred from entering the United States if they are found likely to become public charges,' it says. 'Aliens in the United States who are found likely to become public charges will also be barred from adjusting their immigration status.'",<h2>The Statue of Liberty in cuffs: Mural depicting ICE agents detaining the icon emerges in Vegas as Trump's immigration chief amends the famous inspirational plaque on the U.S. symbol of freedom</h2>

Medical assistance, disaster relief, homeless shelters and Head Start also are not part of the rule, which has long been a priority for Miller.  Age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills will all be assessed in the application process, Cuccinelli said. 'No one factor alone will decide an applicant's case,' he said of the green cards. Additionally, migrants that do not meet the qualifications will have the option to adjust their status to that of a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) through the purchase of a public charge bond that the government plans to sell for a minimum of $8,100 a person, and possibly more, depending on the individual's circumstances. Cuccinelli insisted that the new rule will 'help promote immigrant success' and 'self-sufficiency' of immigrants seeking to become Americans. It's that same 'hard-working spirit' that's made the U.S. a beacon, he claimed. Refugees and asylums seekers will not not be affected, nor will human and sex trafficking victims. An exemption for members of the military and their spouses will also be made.   The administration first signaled that it would seek to adjust the legal definition of a 'public charge' in September 2018 to make the standards for citizenship more rigorous than they had been.      'Congress has never defined the charge public charge in the law,' Cuccinelli said Monday. 'Well that is what changes today with this rule.'  He announced, 'Through the public charge rule, President Trump's administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. Ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and becoming successful in America.'  A White House fact sheet revealed that the administration also plans to use the new rule to keep migrants from ever stepping foot in the country, if the administration decides they're too risky, based on the updated guidance. 'Aliens will be barred from entering the United States if they are found likely to become public charges,' it says. 'Aliens in the United States who are found likely to become public charges will also be barred from adjusting their immigration status.'",<h2>'Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet': Donald Trump's immigration chief REWRITES plaque on the Statue of Liberty to push crackdown to stop immigrants on food stamps from getting green cards</h2>

The 19-year-old's mother can barely contain her joy as she looked at her residence card or green card affixed to the notice.  Carrillo's teary-eyed mom then walks over to his dad for a hug. The video, which Carrillo posted on his Twitter account @its_alex_53, has generated over 7 million views since last Wednesday.

'For those ignorant trump supporters who say “why don’t they just come here legally” it took my parents 25 YEARS and THOUSANDS of dollars to finally become residents. Blessed to say my parents dreams finally became true,' Carrillo on his Twitter account. Living in the United States as undocumented immigrants, especially with Donald Trump in control of the White House, meant that his parents couldn't travel to Mexico to visit his mother's side of the family. All of his dad's family members live in the U.S. Verónica's immigrant status in the U.S. perhaps reached its lowest point when her parents died '1-2 years ago' and she couldn't travel back to bid farewell to them.

17,7349019," Published: 15:21 BST, 12 August 2019 ","The Trump administration announced Monday that it will crack down on green cards for immigrants who've spent more than a year on food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits designated for low-income residents.  U.S. officials argued that the rule change will make migrants more self-sufficient, while White House claimed it was merely enforcing a 'Clinton-era law' to protect the social safety net.   However, the state of California says it will sue to protect the rights of its residents.     Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said Monday that beginning Oct. 15, the rules will change green cards will change The Trump administration is cracking down on green cards for immigrants who've spent more than a year on food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits designated for low-income residents Donald Trump has long sought to recast the number of migrants who are allowed to enter country through familial ties via a process called chain migration The White House hung its hat on the fact the law it's relying on passed during Bill Clinton's administration Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said earlier in the day that beginning Oct. 15 any 'individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period' will not be eligible for a green card.  Individuals who take two public benefits will see that time cut in half, he explained during a briefing at the White House.  'Our rule generally prevents aliens who are likely to become a public charge from coming to the United States or remaining here and getting a green card,' he stated.   Public benefits are defined in the rule as state, local and federal income-based assistance and some non-cash benefits. That includes Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and most forms of Medicaid.  Low-income migrants living in America who want to become U.S. citizens will face additional hurdles after Oct. 15.    Anyone who has spent a year on food stamp, Medicaid or some other public benefit designed for the needy, is all but certain to be denied a green card.  The rule will state that any 'individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period' will not be eligible to remain in the United States permanently. Individuals who take two public benefits will see that time cut in half.  Anyone taking advantage of three government resources that are now restricted must essentially quit the services for three years to be considered for a green card. Refugees and asylums seekers will not not be affected, nor will human and sex trafficking victims.  An exemption for members of the military and their spouses will also be made.  Participants in the National School Lunch Program or The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are left alone. Medical assistance, disaster relief, homeless shelters and Head Start are not counted as public benefits. It does not include benefits for children and pregnant women like the National School Lunch Program or The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Cuccinelli said. Medical assistance, disaster relief, homeless shelters and Head Start are not part of the rule.  The rule will take effect on Oct. 15 and Cuccinelli said that career officials processing forms will not consider certain non-cash benefits that migrants received prior to that date. Age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills will all be assessed in the application process, he said. 'No one factor alone will decide an applicant's case,' he said of the green cards. Additionally, migrants that do not meet the qualifications will have the option to adjust their status to that of a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) through the purchase of a public charge bond that the government plans to sell for a minimum of $8,100 a person, and possibly more, depending on the individual's circumstances.

'Well that is what changes today with this rule.'  He announced, 'Through the public charge rule, President Trump's administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. Ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and becoming successful in America.'  Essentially, U.S. officials are seeking to isolate immigrants they suspect will be a burden to taxpayers by taking citizenship and the legal rights that come with it off the table for needy migrants.  Cuccinelli said that the rule update will merely ensure that existing law is 'meaningfully enforced' and puts into effect the authority that Congress has already given the administration.   A White House fact sheet revealed that the administration also plans to use the new rule to keep migrants from ever stepping foot in the country, if the administration decides they're too risky, based on the updated guidance. 'Aliens will be barred from entering the United States if they are found likely to become public charges,' it says. 'Aliens in the United States who are found likely to become public charges will also be barred from adjusting their immigration status.' It claimed that non-citizens are abusing welfare benefits intended for poor Americans and taking advantage of the nation's generosity.    The White House said that that 58 percent of all households that fall into this category are using at least one welfare program and half have at least one person on Medicaid. Donald Trump has long sought to recast the number of migrants who are allowed to enter country through familial ties via a process called chain migration, where one family member living in America sponsors another, and another, and another. The process creating a chain of people who might not have the kinds of workplace skills that a growing and industrialized economy warrants.  He also wants to do away with the diversity visa lottery system, that picks applicants for approval at random.  They're heavily vetted by the State Department before they're approved for residency. The president has claimed for years, incorrectly, that countries are sending over degenerates. 'The people that are sent to our country are not the people that we want,' Trump said earlier this year. 'They come in through the lottery, they come in through chain migration.'  His administration has been working on legislation for the last year that would make legal immigration point and merit based, to help increase the number of immigrants coming over who are contributing to American innovation and GDP growth. That pitch is still at the starting gate, and his administration has, in the meantime, sought other means to make the United States a less attractive option for poor migrants.   'We've been pressing ahead, and this rule is an example of that,' the president's immigration and naturalization head said. Cuccinelli denied that the rule's implementation is not an admission by the White House that the reforms to the president is seeking to the legal immigration system will not happen. 'Absolutely not. Absolutely not,' he said. 'This does not substitute, does not substitute for congressional action in other areas.' He said that the administration is relying on Congress to take action to stiffen asylum regulations, for instance.  The Monday morning announcement that his agency would force migrants to choose between the possibility of citizenship and putting food on the table had liberals up in arms. The Center for American Progress invoked the El Paso shooting, which a suspected killer said in a manifesto came as a response to an 'invasion' of Hispanic immigrants coming to America, in a statement decrying the new green card rules. 'In El Paso, we saw the painful consequences of this climate of hate,' said Philip Wolgin, managing director of Immigration Policy at the Washington, D.C. think tank. 'Today’s action illustrates that the Trump administration will stop at nothing to attack immigrants and people struggling to make ends meet.'  Trump's crackdown does not include benefits for children and pregnant women The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), like the center above, in Boston, specializes in CAP claimed that the 'rule directly targets children, LGBTQ individuals, people seeking medical care, and people with disabilities' based on provisions pertaining to food stamps and Medicare. 'This rule prioritizes money over family and tells immigrants that if they want to achieve the American dream, they’d better do it before they get here. Just like the administration’s policy of separating families and putting children in cages at the border, the public charge proposal is unquestionably cruel and goes against our fundamental values as a nation,' Wolgin argued. Democratic congresswoman Rosa de Lauro, of Connecticut, said in a statement that the rule change is a 'demonization of immigrants' and an attempt to dismantle the social safety net for individuals in need. 'He continues to make immigrants the scapegoat for a lack of good-paying jobs, even though it is his own policies that have failed to jumpstart wage growth for working people. And we have seen the damage this hatred has caused in recent days,' she said in the statement, hinting at El Paso. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called it an 'attack on families and lower income communities of color' and pledged to legal action to defend residents of the state. Ken Oliver, senior director of Engagement & Right on Immigration at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said the administration is making a 'totally legitimate' change to the rules that will help reduce the burden on American taxpayers, though. Oliver said he believes that the new restrictions will be a winning issue for the Republican president  who pledged to reform American's immigration system as he seeks reelection next year. 'What's not a winning issue is when the left is having the spectacle of Americans seeing leftist politicians favor including non-citizens in program after program that they have to pay for,' he argued.

18,7345427," Published: 02:06 BST, 11 August 2019 ","Secret plans have been drawn up by Michael Gove's Brexit 'war Cabinet' to freeze business in the Commons next month to stop Remainers hijacking No Deal, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The legal framework needed to leave the European Union on October 31 could be passed by MPs afterwards, Ministers were told on Tuesday. Theresa May's Government had previously insisted that five separate Bills – covering customs, immigration and trade – were needed before any kind of Brexit. Secret plans: Mr Gove has drawn up the scheme in a bid to drive through Brexit  But a new paper presented by Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has destroyed that notion. Instead, he says a series of 'statutory instruments' – legal tweaks done with the flick of a ministerial pen without a vote – would be enough. The stark decree will infuriate MPs of all parties trying to sabotage Boris Johnson's plan for No Deal, and Downing Street will face accusations that it will leave the UK in a legal limbo. To make sure the country doesn’t get into a flap after a No Deal Brexit, the Government has launched several operations named after birds. The first was Yellowhammer last year. The actual bird has a distinctive call, though rather worryingly in view of fears about food shortages, it is said to sound like ‘a little bit of bread with no cheese’. Last week, Operation Kingfisher was announced. This is a Treasury-backed cash injection into British businesses that face going under after we take wing from the EU at the end of October. Unfortunately, the colourful riverside bird is vulnerable to hard winters. The latest codeword is Black Swan, which refers to worst-case scenarios as we leave the Brussels birdcage. This large waterfowl can be found in a loose group… but is often alone.      Mr Gove, who chairs daily meetings of the EU Exit Operations committee and is in charge of Whitehall's No Deal planning, has told Government departments to 'minimise legislation' before November to avoid showdowns with Remainer Labour and Lib Dem MPs, who plan to join forces with Tory rebels to thwart Mr Johnson. The Prime Minister has pledged that the UK will leave the EU 'by any means possible' on Halloween. But MPs will return on September 3 for two weeks vowing to block Brexit. Anti-Brexit campaigners such as former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve will try to wrestle control of the parliamentary calendar to extend Commons hours in a bid to derail No Deal, possibly cancelling a planned recess during the party conference season. Mr Gove is leading the charge on No Deal planning and he used the first full meeting of the new Cabinet to attack former Chancellor Philip Hammond. He declared that 'previously there had been those who had seen preparation for No Deal as a distraction'. Since then Mr Gove has chaired a dozen meetings of the Brexit war Cabinet – known as XO – which meets in a room in the basement of the Cabinet Office every weekday at 10.30am. Ministers who are away can use video or phone links, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did throughout last week during his visit to the US, Canada and Mexico to explore new trade deals after Brexit. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill and Mr Johnson's powerful aide Dominic Cummings sit in on XO meetings, with Revenue & Customs chief Sir Jonathan Thompson the only mandarin with a full-time position. Four large screens are updated throughout the meeting and display 'actions' for departments and Ministers to take. Pushing ahead with Brexit: Mr Johnson has been forging ahead with planning for October 31 One committee member said: 'It's pacy stuff. We are running through a lot of detail, with decisions made very quickly. We have sorted out more in two weeks than in the whole previous year. Before, the Treasury was blocking everything, demanding to know what the business case of every tiny thing was, whereas things are serious now and ten to 15 actions are agreed every day.' The MoS can also reveal that the central tenets of the Government's No Deal planning have been agreed by XO. A source who attends the meetings said: 'All decisions are framed through protecting security, flow and revenue, in that order.' Public safety and national security are paramount, followed by keeping Britain's trade flowing and protecting the revenue of the Government and British businesses. XO has also adopted a 'continuity approach', with the UK recognising EU standards in the short term to avoid trading chaos.  Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid talked Election tactics late into the night while drinking the Italian red wine adored by the Duchess of Sussex. The Prime Minister invited the Chancellor and his wife Laura for dinner last weekend at Chequers, marking a dramatic easing of the tension between No 10 and No 11 Downing Street exhibited by their predecessors. Mr Javid arrived at the Buckinghamshire estate with a stash of £80 Tignanello, a Tuscan red that Mr Johnson admitted was his favourite wine last month, and the Chancellor claims to have enjoyed for years. The Duchess of Sussex loves the luxury tipple so much that she even named her now-defunct lifestyle blog The Tig. Mr Johnson’s girlfriend Carrie Symonds, who had previously served as an adviser to Mr Javid, was also present at the dinner. The event marked a clear reset in relations between the two most powerful offices in Government, with Mr Javid given the green light by the Prime Minister to attend any important Downing Street meetings. Insiders say their relationship is much more similar to the one enjoyed by David Cameron and George Osborne, as opposed to their successors, Theresa May and Philip Hammond respectively. A source said: ‘By the end of the last Government, Theresa and Philip could barely stand the sight of each other. Boris and Sajid couldn’t be more different.’ The insider added: ‘They know that the relationship between them will have an impact on the functioning of government and there is goodwill on both sides to make it strong – unlike before. ‘It helps that this Chancellor will be seen as an asset to the party. ‘Sajid is back in the inner circle by attending the PM’s morning meetings. They’re so close that they share a joke – not only has Boris adopted his leadership policies but his wine too.’ As his first policy announcement after taking power, Mr Johnson said 20,000 new police officers would be recruited, which had been Mr Javid’s flagship promise during the Tory leadership election. During the campaign, Mr Johnson told the website Politico Playbook: ‘Someone bought me a crate of Tignanello and I had no idea how expensive it was. I was just glugging it back.’ He added: ‘It’s extraordinary stuff, it was delicious. I discovered later that it was the favourite wine of Meghan Markle. I was so amazed by this wine, I thought, “What is this stuff?” ’  Inspection of goods coming into the UK will be limited, with Britain adopting Brussels regulations temporarily on imports, medicines testings, live animal exports and data sharing. The stance was adopted after lobbying by the car industry, which warned that production at UK plants would be shut down if there were dramatic changes immediately after exit day. Arrangements for a five-month standstill on airline, rail and haulage rules, which were agreed in principle with the EU before the abortive attempt to leave in March, will also be reconsidered. Mr Gove's committee has full control over Operation Yellowhammer, the codename for No Deal contingency planning, as well as Operation Kingfisher, an emergency support package for British businesses affected by No Deal, which was first revealed by this newspaper in February. The avian code words were drawn at random by a Whitehall computer and they have now been joined by another – Black Swan – for worst-case scenarios.  Last week, Mr Cummings and Mr Johnson's policy adviser Oliver Lewis summoned all department aides to No 10 and gave them 48 hours to unearth every potential 'Black Swan' problem. Mr Cummings said he did not care 'how bad the problems are as long as you tell us'. And he warned that if major issues were unearthed later, he would sack the special advisers and ministerial aides responsible. He warned them not to allow the Civil Service to cause difficulties, saying: 'You have been personally authorised by the office of the Prime Minister to undertake this work, and if anyone has a problem with that, tell them to call me.' Potential 'Black Swans' include businesses suffering from 'No Deal fatigue' or a 'disbelief that it will occur', so dragging their feet in planning. There are major fears that in the long term, two of the UK's six main oil refineries could close because imports would become cheaper, triggering a 'significant impact on local economies and regional fuel supply'. The Brexit war cabinet has accepted that food prices will rise in the case of No Deal, with the increased costs continuing into the next decade, and it has been warned that the courts face being overwhelmed with cases of increased 'volume and complexity' due to changes from EU to UK law. But the main concern is still the Irish border, where Ministers have agreed a short-term model of 'no checks with limited exceptions'. But they admit this is 'unsustainable in the long term' and a new agreement with Dublin and Brussels will be needed. In a chilling warning, the Brexit planners were told last week that No Deal would see Irish 'criminals and dissident groups operating with greater threat and impunity'.",<h2>Revealed: Michael Gove's Brexit 'war Cabinet' draws up secret plan to freeze business in the Commons next month to stop Remainers hijacking No Deal</h2>
19,7345345," Published: 01:41 BST, 11 August 2019 ","Priti Patel will this week be challenged to honour her vow to restore ‘integrity’ to Britain’s immigration system by insisting all immigrant workers must earn at least £36,700 after Brexit. The Home Secretary will be urged to hike the proposed £30,000 minimum salary threshold for all new foreign workers to protect lower-paid, UK-born employees. Currently, the restriction only applies to non-EU migrants but is set to be extended to EU workers after Brexit. The Home Secretary will be urged to hike the proposed £30,000 minimum salary threshold for all new foreign workers to protect lower-paid, UK-born employees. She is pictured in Dover meeting with port officials this week The call for the threshold increase, from the Centre for Social Justice, is coupled with a warning that record levels of low-skilled immigration in recent years have pushed down wages for those born in the UK on lower salaries. In a report to be published tomorrow, the influential centre-Right think-tank also highlights the surge in immigration.  It warns that over the past 50 years, the population has grown by more than ten million – 60 per cent of which is due to immigration. The public believe immigration should be curbed, with around two-thirds believing current levels are too high, the CSJ says. Priti Patel will this week be challenged to honour her vow to restore ‘integrity’ to Britain’s immigration system by insisting all immigrant workers must earn at least £36,700 after Brexit The new report comes after Ms Patel, the daughter of Ugandan immigrants, vowed to restore ‘integrity’ to the immigration system but said it should not be a ‘superficial numbers game’. It also follows Boris Johnson’s announcement of reforms to visa applications to fast-track the ‘brightest minds from around the world’ after Brexit. But the new report calls for action at the other end of the wage scale – warning the minimum salary threshold should be raised to a level ‘commensurate with the status of skilled workers’. And it says the Home Office could still exempt key sectors, such as the NHS, to allow workers earning under £36,700 to continue to come to the UK to work. A review and reform of family-related visas, of which there were 134,789 granted in 2018, should also be carried out. Overall, the think-tank says that while immigration has been a net positive for the British ‘fiscal purse’, much of the population have not benefited. The significant increase in low-skilled immigration has helped put downward pressure on wages for UK-born workers at the bottom of the income spectrum as well as arguably reduced social mobility. The CSJ also argued it was ‘high time’ the Government took seriously the problem of endemic poverty in immigrant and minority communities. The new report comes after Ms Patel, the daughter of Ugandan immigrants, vowed to restore ‘integrity’ to the immigration system but said it should not be a ‘superficial numbers game’. It also follows Boris Johnson’s announcement of reforms to visa applications to fast-track the ‘brightest minds from around the world’ after Brexit [File photo] It cited Small Heath in Birmingham as having one of the largest Bengali and Pakistani communities in the country and is concurrently in the 10 per cent most deprived areas in the UK, according to the Government’s Index of Multiple Deprivation. CSJ policy director Edward Davies said: ‘Since 1971 our population has grown by 10.1 million. Immigration has contributed 61 per cent of that growth. ‘We must have a thorough and discerning policy approach towards immigration. ‘The reality is that high levels of low-skilled immigration have suppressed wages and reduced levels of social mobility. There are real problems of poverty and social breakdown in some immigrant communities.’ The solution was ‘developing a framework that makes entry standards higher for economic migrants but is more generous towards those who have had to flee their home countries. ‘This would boost the UK economy and public services.’","<h2>Home Secretary Priti Patel will be urged to hike the proposed minimum salary threshold for ALL immigrant workers to at least £36,700 after Brexit</h2>"

Demonstrators marched on the streets in Chelsea calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to bring a halt to their raids on undocumented migrants.  Many protesters sat on the street as they linked one another and held placards reading 'Abolish ICE' and 'Close the camps.' Footage also showed a heavy NYPD presence as an automated voice advised protesters to move to the sidewalks. Around 100 people were arrested during an anti-ICE protest in Manhattan which closed down part of the West Side Highway and caused traffic gridlock Demonstrators marched on the streets, (pictured), calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to bring a halt to their raids on undocumented migrants 'You are unlawfully in the roadway and obstructing vehicular traffic. You are ordered to leave the roadway,' an NYPD command speaker is heard saying in the video. NYPD officials told PIX11 that 100 people were arrested and are expected to be charged with disorderly conduct. Motorists were advised that there were road closures and a heavy presence of emergency responders along 12th Avenue and West 22nd Street in Manhattan.  The closure at the West Side Highway and West 26th Street reopened later on Saturday afternoon. Protests have been taking place in different parts of the country, demanding an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents targeting thousands of migrants and separating them from their families.  Protesters unfurled a banner saying the Spanish slang for'F*** ICE' at Donald Trump's rally in Cincinnati earlier this month. Two people were removed by security but their protest was claimed as a victory by an anti-deportation group. The banner read 'chinga la migra.' La Migra is a slang shortening of ICE's full name - Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and can also mean immigration authorities more generally, including Customs and Border Patrol.

Last month, protesters went to a migrant detention center in Colorado and took down the state's flag and the U.S. flag before hoisting up a Mexican flag and a defaced Blue Lives Matter flag in their place.  Nick Metz described in a tweet that the majority of the protesters at the Aurora ICE Processing Center were 'peaceful', even thanking those who 'took the time to thank my cops.'  Officers would later take down the flags and were seen hoisting the American one back up. The protest was part of the #LightsForLiberty events that took place across the country, and was called the 'March to Close Concentration Camps' on Facebook. Last month U.S. authorities launched small-scale operations seeking to arrest undocumented immigrants in an apparent start to President Donald Trump's vow to launch mass deportation round-ups across the United States. Many protesters sat on the street and linked hands demanding that ICE be abolished  Protesters are seen being lined up and put into police vehicles following Saturday's protest  Motorists were advised that there were road closures and a heavy presence of emergency responders along 12th Avenue and West 22nd Street in Manhattan The operation was expected to target hundreds of recently arrived families in about 10 cities who had been ordered deported by an immigration judge. The removal operations are meant to deter a surge in Central American families fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries, with many seeking asylum in the United States. 'We are doing targeted enforcement actions against specific individuals who have had their day in immigration court and have been ordered removed by an immigration judge,' Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Matt Albence told Fox News when asked for an update. Immigration rights activists have said that in many cases immigrants do not receive proper notice of their court dates. The operations came as the Trump administration faces criticism for housing immigrants in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and there are concerns about migrant children being separated from adults by U.S. authorities. ""While we haven´t heard of widespread sweeps, none of our communities should have to live in fear that parents won't come home from work, or kids won't return from school,"" said Lauren Weiner, communications director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued this week to stop the arrests going ahead.  ",<h2>100 anti-ICE demonstrators are arrested after sitting on the street and blocking part of the West Side Highway during a protest in Manhattan</h2>

23,7339537," Published: 01:37 BST, 9 August 2019 ","Since winning power, Boris Johnson has made a series of noisy vows to introduce an ‘Australian-style’ points-based system for immigrants to this country. He has pledged to carry out a ‘radical rewriting of our immigration system’ and ‘restore control of our borders’, adding: ‘For years, politicians have promised an Australian-style points-based system, and I will actually deliver on those promises. Countries like Australia have great systems and we should learn from them.’ The new firebrand Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has echoed him, saying she believes the system Down Under is the way to attract ‘the brightest and best’. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel (far right). Mr Johnson has pledged to carry out a ‘radical rewriting of our immigration system’ and ‘restore control of our borders’ This week, Johnson had a chance to discuss the issue during his first phone call as PM with Australia’s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. Mr Morrison became PM after making a firm pledge to cap immigration at 160,000 a year — 30,000 fewer than previously — and promising to ‘freeze’ the number of refugees allowed in. It is the kind of tough stance Australia is renowned for, and presumably explains why Johnson and Patel keep citing Australia’s approach to immigration: they want to give the impression they will adopt the same firm methods. After the phone call, Downing Street refused to say yesterday whether Johnson raised the topic of immigration. But close scrutiny shows he and Patel are careful to refer only to one aspect of Australia’s policy — the ‘points-based system’. Curiously, that is designed not to cut immigration but to increase it. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison became PM in August 2018 after making a firm pledge to cap immigration at 160,000 a year  So do we need an Australian-style system here? Or is it merely gesture politics? Johnson has always been deeply conflicted on immigration. As London Mayor he lauded the virtues of the multicultural capital and said recently: ‘No one believes more strongly than me in the benefits of migration to our country.’ By contrast, he stood on a provocative anti-immigration platform in the 2016 referendum. An attempt to square this circle could explain Johnson’s interest in ‘Aussie rules’. But Australia’s High Commissioner in London says he has got it wrong. So does the respected independent body MigrationWatch UK. True, Australia does have a points-based system — but it is not the obvious model for anyone wanting to curb immigration here to advocate. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the 'Australian-style' points-based system is the way to attract 'the brightest and best'  Australia is a vast, thinly populated country that has twice our level of net immigration per head of population. The aim of its system is to attract migrants with skills that are in short supply to boost the economy. It is easy to see how Britain might benefit from such a system, offering preferential places to doctors, nurses, scientists, engineers, aircraft maintenance specialists, designers, maths and IT teachers and many others. But what Johnson and Patel have failed to point out is that we already have an arrangement. It is called the Shortage Occupation List and it includes all the jobs referred to above, identifying professions in which we have too few workers. Under our system, UK Visas and Immigration has a category called ‘Tier 2 migrants’. These are ‘skilled workers’ from outside the EU who have a job offer in the UK. They include those transferred here by international companies and workers whose skills are in short supply in our economy. Those hoping to work here need 70 points to gain a Tier 2 visa. Points are based on factors including skills and sponsorship by a UK employer. Yesterday, Johnson announced extra visas for non-EU scientists to show ‘the UK is open to top talent’. The Government has intimated that after Brexit this system could be extended to EU migrants (who can currently come here under EU Freedom of Movement rules). But officials acknowledge privately that it could end up as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with Brussels. The same thing could happen in trade talks with other nations. India has already made it clear that if we want a post-Brexit trade deal, it will demand that thousands more Indian medics, IT experts and others can come to Britain. If Johnson and Patel did their homework, they would learn that our ‘points-based’ system is tougher than Australia’s. Skilled migrant workers are free to travel to Australia and stay until they find a job. Here, they must prove they have a job before they’re let in. MigrationWatch UK chairman Alp Mehmet told the Mail: ‘People often advocate the Australian points-based system without knowing what it is. ‘I can’t imagine what Boris Johnson sees in it, beyond the fact that it goes down well with voters and focus groups. It sounds good and gives the impression of control — but it would allow present levels of immigration to continue.’ His sceptical tone is echoed by the Australian High Commissioner to the UK, George Brandis, who says: ‘It would be wrong for anyone to say that Australia’s points system is about keeping our migration numbers small. They are deliberately large.’ So why is Johnson so keen to copy that system? Perhaps, despite having an Australian (Sir Lynton Crosby) as a key adviser, he has failed to understand it. A less generous explanation would be that he is wilfully misrepresenting it. Promoting such a policy could give the electorate the impression he is being tough on immigration when, in truth, he is doing nothing of the sort. This view was advanced by Channel 4 News political editor Gary Gibbon in his book Breaking Point, about the 2016 EU referendum. Gibbon said Johnson’s Vote Leave team knew the Aussie system wouldn’t work here but deployed it regardless, after pollsters noted how it appealed to working-class voters who see Oz as a largely white country. Political Editor at Channel 4 News Gary Gibbon (pictured) wrote Breaking Point detailing the 2016 EU referendum and the aftermath Gibbon said the policy had ‘no relevance’ to Britain’s needs but that ‘as a campaign tool, it was mercilessly effective’. Others suggest it derives from a further misconception: Australia’s reputation for being hard on immigrants. In fact, they have been brutally unwelcoming towards refugees, not immigrants. Refugees turned down for asylum have been shipped to remote islands. The Human Rights Watch charity says there are ‘serious human rights issues’ with what it calls a ‘draconian offshore processing and settlement policy’. No mainstream politician has ever suggested Britain would treat refugees in such a way, least of all Johnson. Furthermore, while Australian PM Morrison has reduced the cap on immigration, Johnson and Patel have quietly dumped Theresa May’s failed target of below 100,000 a year. When pressed on how he will curb immigration, Johnson says repeatedly: ‘I’m not going to get into a numbers game.’ He has also indicated that up to 500,000 illegal migrants who have been in Britain for ‘many years’ could be allowed to stay. This week, Alp Mehmet published an analysis of seven major surveys which he said show 30 million Britons wish to see a reduction in immigration. More than 18 million would like numbers to come down significantly, with only a small minority in favour of an increase. Mr Mehmet said: ‘Mr Johnson cannot go on ducking the issue. We are deeply concerned by the absence of a firm commitment to bring down the numbers. That may be why he goes on about the Australian system.’ This country may have a lot to learn from the Australians about how to win at cricket, but Boris Johnson has some explaining to do if he is serious about taking lessons from them on controlling immigration.","<h2>SIMON WALTERS: There's a lot we can learn from the Aussies about cricket, but I fear Boris Johnson's plan to copy their points-based migrant policy will see us out for a duck</h2>"

25,7338863," Published: 22:08 BST, 8 August 2019 ","Jimmy Aldaoud, a 41-year-old Iraqi national from Detroit, had never lived in Iraq and did not speak Arabic, but ICE deported him to the Middle Eastern country in June; he died in Baghdad on Wednesday  An ailing Iraqi national who had spent most of his 41 years in Detroit was found dead this week in Baghdad, Iraq, where he was deported by the US government in June for committing multiple criminal offenses. Jimmy Aldaoud had never lived in Iraq and did not speak Arabic. He reportedly begged US Immigration and Custom Enforcement officials not to send him to a country he did not know and where he had no ties, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.  On Wednesday, Aldaoud, who suffered from diabetes and mental illness, according to a family friend, was found dead in Baghdad where he had been living as a vagrant over the past two months. Edward Bajoka, a Detroit immigration attorney and a self-described friend of the Aldaoud family, wrote a post on Facebook announcing the man's passing.  'Jimmy was found dead today in Iraq,' he wrote. 'The likely cause of death was not being able to get his insulin.' According to Bajoka, Aldaoud was a member of Iraq's persecuted Chaldean Catholic minority group. He was also a paranoid schizophrenic. 'His mental health was the primary reason for his legal issues that led to his deportation,' Bajoka added, alluding to Aldaoud's many run-ins with the law in Michigan, including arrests for disorderly conduct and a 2012 home invasion in which he stole power tools. The family friend added: 'Rest In Peace Jimmy. Your blood is on the hands of ICE and this administration.' Edward Bajoka, a lawyer and family friend, announced Aldaoud's dead on Facebook and blamed ICE and the Trump administration  Bajoka later shared a video that Aldaoud was able to record two weeks after arriving in Iraq.  In it, a disheveled-looking Aldaoud explains that he was born in Green and lived in the US from the time he was six months old.  Greece does not recognize birthright citizenship, so he was still considered a citizen of Iraq despite never setting foot in that country.    An ICE spokesperson told Politico, which first reported the story, that Aldaoud had 'an extensive criminal history' that included 20 convictions between 1998-2017, and had twice been ordered deported.  He was convicted on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, domestic violence, and breaking and entering, for which he served 17 months in jail in 2013.  Aldaoud appeared in a short video recorded in Iraq two weeks after his deportation. In it, the diabetic man complained of hunger and lack of insulin The agency spokesperson said Aldaoud had been given medicine before he was deported to Iraq 'to ensure continuity of care.'  Aldaoud was among hundreds of Iraqi nationals arrested to enforce deportation orders. The ACLU sued in 2017 to suspend the deportations and allow people to return to immigration court. ACLU attorney Miriam Aukerman says she and her colleagues 'knew he would not survive if deported.' In the Facebook video recorded in June, Aldaoud said ICE agents told him he was going to Iraq and brushed off his arguments that he had never been to the Middle Eastern country and did not know the local language.  'They wouldn't listen to me, they wouldn't let me call my family,' he recounted. 'They just said, ""You're going to Iraq and your best bet is to cooperate with us. That way, we're not going to chain you up; we'll put you on a commercial flight.""'  Rep Andy Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, condemned Aldaoud's deportation Rep Haley Stevens, a fellow Democrat from Michigan, joined her voice to a chorus of outrage Aldaoud was initially taken to Najaf, which Bajoka, the immigration lawyer, described to The Washington Post as a dangerous place for Chaldean Christians.  With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, non-governmental organizations and his family, the deported man was transferred to Baghdad, where he got some help from the city's small Chaldean community.   Ultimately, Aldaoud ended up on the streets where he had no access to insulin shots for his diabetes.    'I’ve been throwing up, throwing up, sleeping in the street, trying to find something to eat. I’ve got nothing over here,' he says in the video.  Rep Andy Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, condemned Aldaoud's deportation.  'Jimmy's death was both horrific & avoidable,' the congressman tweeted on Wednesday. 'I introduced a bipartisan bill to prevent deportations like Jimmy's, but make no mistake - the Trump Administration could end these cruelties with the stroke of a pen.'   Rep Haley Stevens, a fellow Democrat from Michigan, joined her voice to a chorus of outrage, calling Aldaoud's deportation 'unacceptable.' 'The dangers people face when deported, especially when they are minorities, are ill, or are unequipped to move, are critical,' she tweeted. 'We must change our policies to keep people safe.'","<h2>Detroit diabetic, 41, dies on the streets of Baghdad 'from lack of access to insulin' after being deported to Iraq because of 20 criminal convictions even though he never lived there </h2>"

He criticized Trump for the language he uses about immigration and said it divided society over something that has 'already happened' The New York candidate went onto state that those living without papers were the 'biggest ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" in American history.'  He referred to a policy employed by the military from 1994 to 2011 which banned LGBT members from serving their country if the sexual preference was discovered. It allowed people to be dismissed from the armed forces and sent a message that discrimination was tolerated, according to the Human Rights Campaign. De Blasio hit out at Hannity and Fox for their language when discussing immigrants already in the country. He said: 'This is what I don’t get about the whole discussion bluntly on this network and a lot of other places. 'Why are we allowing ourselves to be divided as a people when in fact this already happened.' Hannity went onto question de Blasio about drugs smuggled across the border and people who commit heinous crimes in the country.  To which he replied: 'People get in with a wall, without a wall, that’s not how you do it.' De Blasio said that immigration policy did need reform and that a proper border team should be equipped with all that they needed. But he added that additional border walls (above) would not help The New York Democratic presidential hopeful said that many undocumented immigrants  who had crossed the border were already part of the 'neighborhoods' in America De Blasio added that equipping border security with all the mechanism it needed could be more successful.  From there he added that the for those committing crimes that the community and police must work together.  De Blasio added: 'There are 170 crime that if they are convicted and they are undocumented, they are out of here.

He went onto argue that he wants everyone in his state to have health care.  De Blasio added: 'Everybody who lives here should get the health care they need, so that everyone can be healthy and not get each other sick.

About 70 family, friends and residents waved goodbye and shouted: 'Let them go! Let them go!'  Later, two more buses arrived.  A tearful 13-year-old boy whose parents are from Guatemala waved goodbye to his mother, a Koch worker, as he stood beside his father.  Some employees tried to flee on foot but were captured in the parking lot.  Workers who were confirmed to have legal status were allowed to leave the plant after having their trunks searched.

Mr Manikam said his condition has had almost no effect on his life, requiring only the occasional blood test and specialist appointments to stay healthy. 'Apart from that I'm absolutely fine there is no time that I've taken off due to my kidney issues,' he said. Mr Manikam has even chosen to opt out of government funded medical treatments and organ donation to avoid burdening the healthcare system. Ms Rajasegaran appeared to be on the verge of tears as she spoke about her family's sacrifice as they faced deportation in less than two weeks. 'I love it here, I genuinely do,' she said.

The full bench of the High Court on Wednesday unanimously found Michaela Banerji breached the public service code of conduct and couldn't claim compensation arising from her 2013 dismissal. It ruled that while the code of conduct did impinge on the implied freedom of political communication, that was not the same thing as a right to free speech and was necessary to maintain confidence in an apolitical public service. Ms Banerji tearfully expressed disappointment in the ruling. 'The only advantage of this case ... was to affirm the role of this freedom of speech for public servants and we've failed,' she told reporters outside the court. 'It's not just a loss for me, it's a loss for all of us and I'm very, very, very sorry.' Using the name 'LaLegale' (pictured), she posted thousands of tweets concerning topics including offshore processing and Australia's international obligations to refugees The public servants' union said the decision had serious implications for almost two million Australians working for federal, state and local government. Ms Banerji was fired in 2013 from the then Department of Immigration and Border Protection after it found she was behind an anonymous Twitter account critical of the agency and government policy. Using the name '@LaLegale', she posted thousands of tweets on topics including offshore processing and Australia's international obligations to refugees. Following complaints by departmental staff, an investigation was launched into whether Ms Banerji breached the public service code of conduct. When she received her termination notice in September 2013 she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and a month later lodged a workers' compensation claim. The claim was refused and Ms Banerji took it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which ruled in her favour. The High Court said the legislation governing the public service did not impose an unjustified burden on the implied freedom of political communication, and therefore Ms Banerji's sacking was lawful (stock image) As well, the tribunal found the public service's rules around the use of social media and making public comment 'unacceptably trespassed on the implied freedom of political communication'. However, the High Court unanimously said the tribunal erred in this interpretation. In reasons written by a majority, the court said it was unfortunate the AAT appeal was framed in terms that suggested the implied freedom of political communication was a personal right such as US First Amendment or those included in the Canadian bill of rights. 'As has been emphasised by this court repeatedly ... the implied freedom of political communication is not a personal right of free speech,' Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justices Virginia Bell, Patrick Keane and Geoffrey Nettle wrote. Rather than allowing people to say anything they like, that implied freedom only restricts legislative powers. 'The provisions (of the Public Service Act) are targeted. They do not apply to the public at large,' Justice Michelle Gordon wrote in separate reasons. The court found the laws were consistent with and important for maintaining an apolitical public service. Allowing public servants to harshly criticise government policy or members of parliament, even anonymously, could seriously undermine public confidence in the bureaucracy, it ruled. Justice James Edelman noted that until the 1970s there was a total ban on public servants expressing political opinions. 'The code that now regulates their behaviour no longer turns public servants into lonely ghosts,' he wrote. 'But, properly interpreted, it still casts a powerful chill over political communication.' Community and Public Sector Union national secretary Nadine Flood said in the years since Ms Banerji's sacking, the rules governing public servants using social media had become even more draconian. ''The CPSU has always defended the rights of public servants to participate in our democracy like everyone else can,' she said. 'The Morrison government needs to demonstrate that it prioritises democratic rights, with a social media policy that reflects the real world.' ",<h2>High Court strikes a blow against free speech: Judges back public service bosses who sacked a woman after she slammed them using an ANONYMOUS Twitter account</h2>

You are not stronger if you tear another life down.' While the massacres have reupped calls for stricter gun regulations like background checks, raising the age of those able to purchase a gun and banning high capacity magazines, Ocasio-Cortez says the issue is bigger than that.

Peter Martin, 51, was arrested by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel French terminal in Coquelles in October 2016 after they found 11 Albanian nationals hidden in the back of his hired Ford Transit van. The Albanians - 10 men and one woman - were passed to the French Police Aux Frontieres. The case was passed to Immigration Enforcement's Criminal and Financial Investigation (CFI) team and Martin was ultimately charged with assisting unlawful immigration into the UK and released on court granted bail. On May 3, 2017, he appeared for a pre-trial hearing at Canterbury Crown Court in Kent but shortly afterwards he stopped complying with his bail conditions. Three months later a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. And in March this year the law finally caught up with him when he was arrested by police at an address in Ipswich. Martin pleaded not guilty when he was produced for the start of his trial at Canterbury Crown Court on July 29. He admitted attempting to smuggle the people into the UK, but claimed to be acting under duress, stating that he was being threatened by a group of Albanians. Martin, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex claimed the unidentified gang had threatened to kill him and his immediate family if he did not collect the people from France and bring them to the UK. But the jury were not convinced and took less than an hour to find Martin guilty last Friday. He was sentenced on Monday at the same court on Monday. Officials found 11 Albanians - 10 men and one woman (pictured) - among crates of alcohol in the van Nick Drinkal, Director of Border Force South East and Europe, said: 'Before the van was opened Martin told Border Force officers that he had been to France to buy beer for a party, but when the doors were unlocked officers found the majority of the space was taken up with people rather than alcohol. 'We will continue to work with other UK and French law enforcement agencies to ensure that people smugglers and traffickers, whose actions so often put the lives of others at risk, face the full consequences of their crimes.' Assistant Director David Fairclough, from CFI, said: 'Martin thought he could escape justice, but this case demonstrates that law enforcement's reach is wide and its memory is long. Ultimately, there is no hiding place. 'This was an unsophisticated attempt to smuggle people into the UK illegally. Martin knew what he was doing was wrong and contrary to his claims, was not acting under duress. 'I hope Martin's imprisonment sends a clear message that anyone who engages in this kind of criminality will be caught and brought before the courts.'",<h2>People smuggler who went on the run after 11 Albanian immigrants were found hidden in the back of his hired Ford Transit van is jailed for more than five years</h2>

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the Homeland Security Committee next week will convene hearings on the 'national and personal security threat of white supremacy and domestic terrorism.' They will be overseen by panel chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, a member of the black caucus.  Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said it was time for President Donald Trump to stop 'flailing around,' and called on him to push House-passed legislation to impose background checks on all gun purchases Schumer issued his call shortly before Trump addressed the nation following the pair of mass shootings over the weekend, after Trump floated the idea of tying 'strong background checks' to 'desperately needed immigration reform' legislation. Gun-control legislation almost always faces a fraught path in Congress, and tying it to Trump's highly controversial call for a border wall would almost certainly add a new layer of complication.  The president did not mention the idea of tying in immigration reform from his White House remarks Monday morning. His most direct comment on gun control was to dismiss it as a primary solution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi organized a teleconference with her caucus in response to the shootings. The Homeland Security panel is holding hearings next week on white supremacy 'Instead of flailing around blaming everything under the sun, if the president is serious about 'strong background checks' there's one thing he can do: Demand Sen. McConnell put the bipartisan, House-passed universal background checks bill up for a vote,' Schumer tweeted. Schumer was referencing Senate Majority Leader McConnell, who has the power to bottle up gun control legislation or call up a bill at any time.  Pelosi is also keeping the focus on McConnell.  'The president and Mitch McConnell have to feel the public sentiment on this. We have a golden opportunity to save lives,' she told fellow Democrats on a conference call, an aide told Politico. 'The grim reaper said he is not going to bring them up,' she added, using McConnell's nickname. 'This is where we have to go.'  House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerod Nadler is offering to bring his panel back during recess to assemble legislation to bring back the assault weapons ban. Former President Bill Clinton called for a return of the gun regulation in a tweet Monday.   Earlier, Schumer called on McConnell to 'stop blocking gun safety reforms over 90% of Americans support' and gavel the Senate into emergency session to 'take immediate action on the bipartisan, House-passed universal background checks legislation.' In his most pointed line on gun control Monday, Trump dismissed an argument by those who want further restrictions that high-powered assault rifles are a driving cause of the problem. 'Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,' Trump said. His comment came on a day his hometown newspaper, the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, called in a front page editorial for Trump and Congress to 'Ban Weapons of War.' The president did not call for an assault weapons ban or for a new system of widespread background checks in his remarks. Evidence markers rest on the street at the scene of a mass shooting Sunday, Aug. 4, 2019, in Dayton, Ohio. Several people in Ohio have been killed in the second mass shooting in the U.S. in less than 24 hours, and the suspected shooter is also deceased, police said Police tape drapes over a chair near a pile of shoes after a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio on Sunday, Aug, 4, 2019 Instead, after calling out the 'glorification of violence,' treatment of the mentally ill, the Internet, and video games, Trump called for making sure 'those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process.' He was referencing so-called red flag laws that allow the use of court orders to deny firearms to certain individuals.  The House bill Schumer pointed to requires background checks for all sales and transfers of firearms, including at gun shows. A separate House bill imposes a 10-day review period for gun purchases. Both passed the House in February but never came up in the Senate.  Trump didn't say in his tweet why potential 'strong background checks' should be tied to immigration. The El Paso suspect has been tied to a sick manifesto where the author blames an 'invasion' of immigrants, and federal authorities are investigating a possible bias motivation.  Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a joint statement where they hammered Trump for backing down from his call for background checks within hours. 'In February, the new Democratic House Majority promptly did its duty and passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which is supported by more than 90 percent of the American people and proven to save lives,' they said. 'However, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has called himself the 'grim reaper' and refuses to act on this bipartisan legislation. It is incumbent upon the Senate to come back into session to pass this legislation immediately,' they continued. 'It took less than three hours for the president to back off his call for stronger background check legislation. When he can't talk about guns when he talks about gun violence, it shows the president remains prisoner to the gun lobby and the NRA. The public must weigh in and demand passage of this legislation for the safety of our children,' they concluded. President Donald Trump delivered remarks on the morning of Monday, August 5, 2019, less than 48 hours after a pair of deadly mass-shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio devastated Americans: ––– 'Good morning. 'My fellow Americans, this morning our nation is overcome with shock, horror and sorrow. This weekend more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning in El Paso, Texas a wicked man went to a Wal-Mart store where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people and injured 26 others, including precious little children. 'Then in the early hours of Sunday morning, in Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered nine people including his own sister, and injured 27 others. 'The first lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault on our communities, an attack upon our nation and a crime against all humanity.  'We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. 'America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer. And we vow to act with urgent resolve. 'I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas, and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. 'Today we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico and all the people of Mexico for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. 'I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required, whatever is needed. 'The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online, consumed by racist hate. In one voice our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul.  'We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Whatever they need. 'We must recognize that the Internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the Internet and stop mass-murders before they start. 'The Internet, likewise, is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the Internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored. 'In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another, over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost, by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real bipartisan solutions – we have to do that, in a bipartisan manner – that will truly make America safer and better for all. 'First we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass-shooters before they strike. 'As an example, the monster in the Parkland High School in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not? 'Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly videogames that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. 'Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That's what we have to do. 'Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence, and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun. 'Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red-flag laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders. 'Today I'm also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass-murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively and without years of needless delay.  'These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. 'Last year we enacted the Stop School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses. But there is so much more that we have to do. 'Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside – so destructive – and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have, and we always will, win. 'The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters. It is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain. 'May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'    ",<h2>House homeland chairman organizes hearings on white supremacy for next week as Pelosi tells her troops to keep focus on 'grim reaper' McConnell and Schumer calls for Donald Trump to stop 'flailing around' on background checks</h2>

The One Nation leader leader in June tweeted that foreigners had made up the bulk of Australia's population growth, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison had vowed to trim net immigration levels. 'The Australian population grew by 400,000 people last year,' she said. 'The majority of this came from overseas migration.  Pauline Hanson's views on immigration have been endorsed by an unlikely media outlet - the ABC (pictured is the One Nation leader in the Senate with her party colleague Malcolm Roberts) 'Next time Morrison says the Liberals are cutting immigration remember it is just a marketing ploy.  'Their budget is built off mass migration.'  The ABC has now agreed with Senator Hanson, with the RMIT/ABC Fact Check declaring her comments were 'close to the mark'. It published a graph showing immigration made up 61.4 per cent of Australia's population growth in 2018. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University and the national broadcaster last week also acknowledged she had a point when it came to immigration being used to boost budget revenue. 'While the extent of migration's impact on the federal budget is difficult to quantify, its contribution is acknowledged in the budget papers as having a key influence on the government's economic projections,' they said. The One Nation leader leader in June tweeted that foreigners had made up the bulk of Australia's population growth, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison had vowed to trim net immigration levels In March, ahead of the May election, Mr Morrison promised to slash Australia's net annual immigration rate by trimming the number of temporary migrants being granted permanent visas from 190,000 to 160,000. In 2018, 832,560 foreigners moved to Australia. When departures were factored in, last year's net annual immigration rate stood at 291,250, a level that was four times the 20th century average of 70,000. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is yet to publish births and deaths for 2018.  Australia welcomed 309,142 babies in 2017 as 160,909 people died. In 2018, 832,560 foreigners moved to Australia. When departures were factored in, last year's net annual immigration rate stood at 291,250, a level that was four times the 20th century average of 70,000 (pictured is Sydney International Airport) When the natural population increase of 148,233 was added with net immigration, Australia's population increased by 439,483 last year, showing that Senator Hanson was right all along. In February, a record 115,100 migrants moved to Australia but this fell to 53,320 in May, the lowest monthly number in a year.  RMIT and the ABC also acknowledged that Australia's population growth pace of 1.6 per cent was the fourth highest in the world after Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg and New Zealand. The level of population increase is also more than double the 0.6 per cent pace of the United States and Britain and even higher than Canada's 1.4 per cent. ",<h2>Aunty backs Hanson!

Amilcar Guiza-Reyes, 51, confessed to immigration agents when he presented himself at the border with the six-month-old boy and was told he would be required to undergo a DNA test. According to U.S. officials, the undocumented immigrant, Guiza-Reyes  reportedly bought the child during his stop in the western Guatemalan town of Huehuetenango and continued his journey through Mexico before reaching the southern U.S. border where he was detained May 7. The case is one of thousands which officials flagged as potentially fraudulent in recent weeks. The child,  whose name was withheld for privacy reasons, was transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services for placement. Homeland Security Secretary interim director Kevin McAleenan 300,000 children have crossed the Mexico-United States border since October, 2018. Pictured above are unaccompanied migrant children being released from a Florida shelter July 15 (file image) The department of Homeland Security has dispatched 400 agents to interview families that are suspected of handing over fraudulent documents. Agents have identified 5,500 fraudulent families - about 15 percent of all cases referred - over the last eight weeks.  During a July 18 hearing with the House Oversight Committee, the acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said that agents discovered that migrants were also renting and kidnapping children in order to persuade immigration officials of their familial ties. McAleenan added that migrants had paid anywhere between '$100 up to $1,000 or more.'  'That tells me that we might be scratching the surface of this problem and the number of children being put at risk might be even higher,' Kevin McAleenan said. The interim HSI head said asylum seekers were using the minors as pawns in their bid to be admitted into the United States. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in July that investigators arrested a Honduran migrant who bought a six-month-old baby in Guatemala for $80 because he was told that family units received preferential treatment at the southern United States border when presenting their asylum petitions 'Everybody knows that if they bring a child, they'll be allowed to stay in the United States,' McAleenan added. 'They call it a 'passport for migration.' I heard that directly from a gentleman from Huehuetenango, the westernmost province of Guatemala.' The HSI acting chief said investigators uncovered 921 false documents and at least 615 people were charged with trafficking or smuggling children. 'We’ve seen all manner of smuggling organizations communicating to potential customers and to those crossing the border how to bring a child with them to be allowed to stay in the United States. They’ve been active in advertising, literally on Facebook and on the radio in Central America,' McAleenan said. In February, Guatemalan migrant Maynor Velásquez Molina told U.S. border officials at the border crossing in Lukeville, Arionza, that he too purchased an eight-year-old boy from a family for only $130 because he was told it was easier to be admitted. He also paid an additional $130 for a fake birth certificate. In July, Mexican authorities warned refugee mothers about men seeking to buy migrant children to improve their chances of asylum at the United States border. Officials have grown concerned after men from 'Central America or Haiti' were seen approaching mothers - especially those deemed vulnerable - at the Iglesia Evangelica Embajadores de Jesus shelter in Tijuana offering them $350 to purchase a child to cross into the U.S. McAleenan also told the House Oversight Committee that more than 300,000 children have crossed the Mexico-United States border since October, 2018. The majority of the children came to the U.S. as part of family units.  However, at least 67,000 entered the country unaccompanied.  McAleenan said data showed that family units spiked by 469 percent from the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 compared with the same period in fiscal year 2019.","<h2>Honduran migrant, 51, 'purchased a six-month-old baby for $80 in Guatemala so that he could seek asylum as a family when he crossed the U.S. border'</h2>"

It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders,' she said. 'We need to continue to have border security, and we can do that, but what we can't do is not live our values.'

Sanders then claimed,'If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view, they are not criminals.'  Montana Gov. Steve Bullock rebutted: 'I think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from people's lives. We've got 100,000 people showing up at the border right now. If we decriminalize entry, if we give health care to everyone, we'll have multiples of that. Don't take my word, that was President Obama's Homeland Security secretary that said that.' He likewise told Warren, 'You are playing into Donald Trump's hands. The challenge isn't that it's a criminal offense across the border. The challenge is that Donald Trump is president and using this to rip families apart the same immigration system needs a same leader, and we can do that with that decriminalizing the health care for everyone.'  Warren told Bullock, 'What you're saying is ignore the law - and words matter and it matters. If we say that our law is that we will walk people up who come here, seeking refuge and seeking asylum, that is not a crime.' She said the country must adopt a system that 'keeps us safe at the border but does not criminalize the mother fleeing' violence in her home country. Asked by a moderator if Sanders, who'd been asked the question first, would have illegal immigrants coming to the U.S. in search of free health care, Ryan said, 'Yes. Right now, if you want to come into the country you should at least ring the doorbell.  'We have asylum laws,' he said. 'It's shameful what is happening but Donald Trump is doing it and even if you decriminalize, which you should not do, you still have statutory authority and the president could use his authority to separate families.' Buttigieg said at the argument's opening that 'we can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law,' but candidates should agree that family separation is cruel.  'It is a stain on the United States of America,' he said. 'Americans want comprehensive immigration reform. And frankly, we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime, protections for DREAMers; making sure that -- that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented; cleaning up lawful immigration. He said, 'We know what to do. We know that border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington.  'And now we have a president who could fix it in a month, because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.'  Trump has hinged his reelection campaign on the argument that Democrats are for 'open borders' and would be a magnet for criminal immigrants and gang members. So would democratic socialist Sanders' free health care program, his campaign argued in a new ad that it released just before the debate. It featured Democratic candidates, including Sanders, raising their hands at the first debate, in June in Miami, to indicate they'd provide free healthcare to undocumented immigrants - a proposal the Republican president and his supporters have said is unfeasible. Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale immediately fired back with accusation in a tweet that Democrats on the debate stage who said they believe that the act of entering America without papers should not be a crime want open borders and crime. 'First hour of debates: No more private insurance. Big government socialism. Open borders,' he charged. ","<h2>2020 Democrats split over decriminalizing illegal border crossings as moderate Tim Ryan mocks ultra-liberals saying: 'If you want to come into this country, you need to at least ring the doorbell!'</h2>"

A survey of 17,500 people confirmed stagnant wages are even worse than first thought, with pay packets falling as immigration has surged. Median household incomes, after tax, are now $542 less than they were during the GFC. Australian households are earning less than they did during the global financial crisis a decade ago (pictured is a stock image of a couple calculating their bills)  They have fallen from $80,637 in 2009 to $80,095 eight years later, new data from the Melbourne Institute's annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) study for 2019 showed. Income growth has been patchy during the past decade, falling in the two years after the GFC, rising in 2012 and mainly stagnating after that. During that time, Australia's population has surged from 21.2million in 2009 to 24million in 2017, before rising above the 25million milestone in August 2018. The Grattan Institute think tank's chief executive John Daley has told a Reserve Bank of Australia seminar that low-skilled migrants were driving down wages. 'Many believe that Australian migration is highly skilled and has nothing to do with the underpayment of minimum wages,' he said in his April presentation, which was made public on Monday. 'That might have been true in the past, but it's less true now.' During that time, Australia's population has surged from 21.2million in 2009 to 24million in 2017, before rising above the 25million milestone in August 2018 (pictured is a Sydney train)  Professor Daley said 59 per cent of temporary visa holders were in low-skilled jobs. For student and working holiday visa holders, that number in low-skilled jobs rises to 75 per cent. With one in five Australian workers on the minimum wage, Professor Daley said 'low-skilled' employment at or below the minimum wage was 'big enough to matter'. Australia is home to one million temporary migrants, with 450,000 of them being on student visas with another 150,000 on working holiday visas. Then there are 250,000 temporary migrants in the 'other' visa category.  If all migrants worked, they would comprise four per cent of Australia's 13million workers. When household incomes were adjusted for needs, the HILDA research found salary levels over five years had gone backwards in Adelaide, Perth and regional New South Wales but had risen in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Poverty levels, defined as income that is half of the median, have also risen in recent years.  Financial hardship levels fell from 12.4 per cent to 9.6 per cent between 2007 and 2016 but rose again in 2017, to reach 10.4 per cent.

The Attorney General's reversal tightens the Immigration and Nationality Act rules that grant asylum if a migrant can prove they have been or would be persecuted in their home country due to 'race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.' It specifically focuses on distinguishing what constitutes a 'social group' – and argues that family relationships do not face threats like those in the same racial or religious group.  'The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,' Barr's Monday decision reads. Attorney General Bill Barr reversed a 2018 decision that allowed migrants to claim asylum if their immediate family was targeted in their home countries 'The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,' Barr said in Monday's reversal The 2018 Immigration and Nationality Act ruled in 2018 that migrants cold claim asylum if their family members were targeted by drug cartels or gangs He asserted that those defined to be a 'particular social group' when seeking asylum must share a 'common immutable characteristic,' not just share in the fact they are family. In 2018, the board create the new rules, which Barr says was 'improperly' decided. The asylum seeking extension came after a migrant said he was being persecuted in his home country because his father was targeted by a local drug cartel. He argued that this qualified as 'membership in a particular social group.' 'Consistent with these prior decisions, I conclude that an alien's family-based group will not constitute a particular social group unless it has been shown to be socially distinct in the eyes of its society, not just those of its alleged persecutor,' the attorney general stated in his decision. 'Because the record does not support the determination in this case that the immediate family of the respondent's father constituted a particular social group, I reverse the Board's conclusion to the contrary,' he continued.  the initial ruling came after a migrant claimed he was being persecuted in his home country because his father was targeted by a local drug cartel  Barr said in the decision being a member of a family does not constitute being part of a certain 'social group' The ruling is a continuation of tightening restrictions on immigrants and migrants seeking asylum at the southern border The decision is a continuation of tightening immigration and migration rules at the southern border since Trump has taken office.  Earlier this year, Barr also revered a 2005 Board of Immigration Appeals ruling that said those being held as their asylum claim was being litigated could be released on bond if they were able to show they feared persecution from the country they were fleeing. That effort has been halted, however, after a district court judge blocked the order when ruling it was unconstitutional to indefinitely detain those seeking asylum. House members left last week for the summer recess and won't return to Washington D.C. until September – leaving many of these asylum rule changes up in the air. In an effort to continue its crack down at the border, the Trump administration issued a rule earlier in July that would stop migrants from claiming asylum if they passed through other countries before arriving at the U.S. southern border. Many migrants claiming asylum in the U.S. are traveling from El Salvador or Honduras, meaning they have to pass through Guatemala and Mexico – both countries they could seek asylum in – before reaching the southern border The rule has already been blocked temporarily by a San Francisco federal district judge.",<h2>Bill Barr ends guarantee of asylum for people whose families are targeted by narco gangs as he rules it's not the same as racial or religious persecution</h2>

Vasquez was Nielsen's second wife but their marriage was not legally recognized because it was faith-based, which meant immigration to the U.S. was not an option.  Nielsen split his time between his wife and family in Salt Lake City and Vasquez and her son Kevin in Mexico.  Paul Nielsen, 48, his 43-year-old wife Janet Vasquez and her son Kevin were on vacation in the Mexican state of Guerrero when they were attacked on July 18.

'They were driving on the highway when three vehicles began chasing them and Kevin said that his mother shouted that they were going to assault them,” Nielsen’s daughter, Priscilla, said in a statement obtained by the New York Post. “Our dad accelerated. Kevin heard shots fired. According to Priscilla, Nieslen tried to flee but the assailants opened fire and he lost control of his car, causing it to veer off the road.

52,7293539," Published: 00:46 BST, 28 July 2019 ","As Home Secretary, I will be proposing a radical rewrite of our immigration system Our new Prime Minister has promised a radical rewrite of our immigration system.  As Home Secretary, I'll be the one making this happen, because this new re-energised and optimistic Government is determined to get the country back on the road to a brighter future. We've waited long enough to get here, so we will realise the benefits of Brexit by getting straight on with the job of grasping the opportunities offered. We are a Government focused on bringing the change people voted for in the referendum and we want to unequivocally make Britain the greatest country on Earth. That means ensuring that we continue to push for a dynamic, global Britain that is outward looking and which lifts our standing in the world. Our vision is for a truly global country – one where we welcome the brightest and best, where we are more outward facing, and where we decide who comes here based on what they have to offer. One of the things that is great about this country is that we're a meritocracy. Aspirational, hard-working people who want to come here – and who have the talent and skills to contribute to our economy and society – are very welcome. And as a daughter of immigrants, I know the immense benefits immigration can bring. There is no dispute about the positive impact of immigration to our country. That is also why we will ensure EU nationals, who have made their homes here and done so much for our country, continue to stay. I'm delighted that over one million have now applied to our settlement scheme, and I hope many more will follow. When it's well managed, migration works in the national interest, for our communities, economy and country.  But we must bring back confidence to our approach and ensure that it works for our nation in the right way and for the right reasons. And to do so we are shaking up the immigration system to make it work for our country and to bring confidence to the public. To do this we must seize the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity offered by the end of free movement.  Free from the shackles of the EU – and an automatic right of entry for their citizens, with or without work – we will be able to give the type of preference to brilliant scientists, academics and highly-skilled workers that we want to see more of.  As a daughter of immigrants, I know the immense benefits immigration can bring. There is no dispute about the positive impact of immigration to our country People like the biological scientists and biochemists the Migration Advisory Committee recently added to the shortage occupation list, because we desperately need more of them in this country. We'll be able to prioritise the people who can and will add significant value to our country. To do this we will build on the proposals in our White Paper to create a fair new skills-based approach. Where decisions are taken based on what someone can contribute rather than where they come from.  Where those who come fill jobs rather than claiming benefits. And where we're tougher on those who abuse our hospitality. We will take the Immigration Bill through Parliament to make sure all this can happen. We'll give top priority to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents – to attract those who add the most value to our economy. These skilled workers will only be able to come here if they have a job offer from an employer registered with the Home Office, and if they can speak English. The end of free movement means that we will be able to consider the impact on the existing labour market when determining whether we want unskilled workers from the EU to be able to come to the UK. Because immigration alone is not the answer. Rather than automatically relying on low-skilled labour from abroad, our new approach means British businesses will have to back our people. They must invest in training, technology and to increase domestic skill levels. We will check all prospective migrants to see if they have a criminal record, to ensure we can exclude those whose past means they're not welcome here. And we will ensure we have a strong border to better tackle illegal immigration and to help keep out terrorists, criminals and those that wish to do this country harm. Change is already on the way. But I will leave no stone unturned to help build our vision of a truly global Britain, and part of that is learning from other countries where things work well. Politicians have long talked about the benefits of an Australian-style points-based system. This is a government of action, not empty promises. So I will be urgently commissioning the Migration Advisory Committee – the Government's independent advisers on immigration matters – to review the system. It will look at elements we can implement to make our system work for the benefit of Britain. Donald Trump has raised the prospect of a 'very substantial' US-UK trade deal, writes Brendan Carlin. He said talks about the post-Brexit deal were under way, claiming it could lead to a 'three to four, five times' increase in trade between the US and UK. Mr Trump, who has already hailed the new Prime Minister as 'Britain Trump', spoke to Mr Johnson by phone on Friday. He added that US-UK trade had previously been 'impeded' by Britain's EU membership. But once the UK leaves, it can expect to do much more trade with the US, he said. Downing Street said the two leaders would begin formal negotiations 'as soon as possible' after the UK leaves the EU. The current migration system means we have to give an automatic right of access to all EU nationals. In future, we will decide who we give preference to, so we can ensure we are able to attract the most talented and skilled from other parts of the world. An Australian-style points-based system will allow us to welcome talented individuals from all over the world. Deal or No Deal, we will introduce a new, better system that will boost our economy. This is an immediate first step from a new, motivated Government determined to do more to make this country even better. Leaving the EU will give us back full democratic control of our immigration system, and the freedom to decide for ourselves who comes here. It is an opportunity we can't afford to squander as we build our vision of a better, bolder Britain. So I am acting now to ensure we deliver a new immigration system that works in the interests of this country and our citizens. That people can finally have confidence in. That gives control over immigration back to the British public. An immigration system that will truly make global Britain a beacon for the very best international talent and truly the greatest place in the world.","<h2>I will shake up immigration, says PRITI PATEL: Home Secretary bluntly reveals her determination to secure our borders - deal or no deal</h2>"

The extension followed numerous calls and emails that were made by immigration advocates, including New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kristen Gillibrand, who all asked that Gámez be allowed to stay out of detention 'I am very sad, really depressed,' the distraught Honduran dad told DailyMail over the phone on Thursday afternoon.  'The hardest moments are coming.' The young girl had been battling bouts of depression amidst President Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies that kept her away from her dad, who in June had been arrested after trying to reenter the United States after he was deported in 2016. Heydi Gámez García lost hope that she would be reunited with her father after he was arrested while trying to enter the United States in June, almost three months after her 13th birthday On July 3 just after midnight, Heydi was found hanging from her bedroom closet with a phone-charging cable tied around her neck by her aunt who decided to cheer her up with a snack and a refreshment.  She was transported to the hospital and sadly declared brain-dead a week later. Family lawyer Anibal Romero blamed the Trump administrations asylum stance as one of the main reasons why Heydi tried to end her life. 'Words matter, tweets matter,' Romero told DailyMail on Thursday. 'When the president threatens to deport millions of people, it really causes anxiety, causes fear, especially in children who are afraid of losing their parents. Politicians should be very careful with the words that are used. It doesn't matter that it's on social networks. ... Today it's Heydi, tomorrow it will be someone else.'

His mother succumbed to a battle with diabetes the following year, which drove him to making the decision of sending Heydi and her aunt Zoila, who at the time was underage, to live with his four other siblings in Long Island, New York, because he considered their Central American nation to be too dangerous a place for the girls to be raised.

She was granted asylum in June 2016 by the U.S. government, which awarded permanent residency in the United States, and quickly picked up on the English language. That same year Manuel attempted to cross the border but was arrested by the Border Patrol in McAllen, Texas. He was intercepted once again in September 2017 by immigration agents near Santa Teresa, N.M. he tried to enter the country and was convicted of illegally re-entering and was sentenced to 45 days in prison before he was deported to Honduras in November.  Amidst pleas from his daughter to be reconnected again - she was even giving him English lessons through video calls - Manuel promised his distraught daughter he would once again try to evade the strict border measures, especially after she turned 13 in March. The determined parent made it to Mexico in early June and gave his daughter the heads up that he was on his way back to New York. Manuel told his daughter that as soon as he made it to Houston it would just take him about a week before they would be together. 'It has been difficult to be away from her,' Manuel said. 'As a father you always want to be with your children. I was hoping to be with her again.' But just like the previous other times, his path to reuniting with Heydi was once again blocked.  On July 13, Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed through with a request from Romero, who was assisted by Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and gave Manuel permission to travel from the holding facility in Texas to be with his daughter - just a few years too late.

55,7286395," Published: 17:24 BST, 25 July 2019 ","Boris Johnson today appeared to drop a Tory pledge to reduce annual net migration to below six figures as he promised to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system.  Mr Johnson said during the 2016 EU referendum campaign that the UK should seek to imitate the Australian system which assesses people on different criteria like age, qualifications and language skills.  Today he told the House of Commons that he would finally deliver the long-promised major overhaul of British border control.  But the decision to seemingly drop the Conservative Party's commitment to reduce net migration to the UK to the 'tens of thousands' is likely to spark controversy among some Leave voters.  David Cameron introduced the pledge back in 2010 but no government has got anywhere close to meeting the six figure target since then.  Boris Johnson, pictured in the House of Commons today, told MPs that he would deliver on a promise he made in the 2016 EU referendum campaign to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system Mr Johnson told the Commons he wanted to make sure the UK continued to attract the 'best and brightest talent from around the world' Mr Johnson told MPs as he addressed them for the first time as Prime Minister: 'Finally, we will also ensure that we continue to attract the best and brightest talent from around the world.  'No one believes more strongly than I do in the benefits of migration to our country, but I am clear that our immigration system must change.  'For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points-based system, and today I will actually deliver on those promises: I will ask the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system, and I am convinced that we can produce a system that the British people can have confidence in.'  The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman was later pushed on whether Mr Johnson would be keeping the 'tens of thousands' target.   The spokesman said: 'He was asked this during the campaign and he said he wasn't going to be playing a numbers game.  'His view is that we need to introduce an Australian points based system which allows us to take back full control of our borders. 'The British public have been promised for a number of years that there would be an Australian points based system which never materialised and he is determined to deliver it which is why he has straight away commissioned MAC to carry out the work required to get that system in place.'  The Australian immigration system has been designed to allow people into the country who the government believes will contribute to the economy and fill skills shortages.  Skilled worker visas are available to people if they score enough points across a number of categories in a points-based assessment with 60 the magic number. One of the key categories is age, with all applicants having to be under 50. Younger applicants are automatically awarded 30 points while those approaching the age of 50 get zero, making it much harder for them to be accepted.  Another key category is the ability to read and write English to a satisfactory level. Points are awarded to people who are particularly 'proficient' while even more are awarded to those deemed 'superior'.  Then there are qualifications and skilled employment history. This is where people must get most of their points from.  For example, five years of skilled work outside Australia is worth 10 points and a PHD qualification receives 20 points. Asked directly if the target had been ditched, the spokesman appeared to confirm that it had been as he said: 'His focus is on getting in place an Australian points based system which will allow us to take back control of our borders.'  The Tories promised at the 2017 general election to introduce 'controlled, sustainable migration, with net migration down to the tens of thousands'. The issue was raised repeatedly during the Tory leadership campaign when Mr Johnson failed to guarantee that he would bring down immigration levels as PM while his challenger Jeremy Hunt said he would.  Mr Johnson said: 'I am not going to get into some numbers game. We will have control. That is what people voted for.'       Mr Hunt was unequivocal as he said: 'I actually agree with Boris about taking back control.  'But people also voted with the expectation that overall levels of net migration would come down.'  The Tory battle over the best approach to immigration has been raging for years. Britain's departure from the EU, and the end of free movement from the continent, has ignited a fierce debate about what the UK's post-Brexit system should look like.     In June Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, announced a review of how much money people will have to earn to come and work in Britain as he paved the way for the next government to tear up a flagship Theresa May policy.  Mr Javid announced salary thresholds for migrant workers will be looked at before changes are made in a move which likely to lead to a softening of the rules.  He asked the Migration Advisory Committee - the independent body which advises the Government on immigration matters - to consider whether an existing threshold of £30,000 for experienced workers is still appropriate.  It is the latest action taken by the Home Secretary which will be seen as a direct challenge to Mrs May over her approach to immigration.  ",<h2>Boris Johnson DROPS long-standing Tory pledge to reduce number of migrants coming to the UK to 'tens of thousands' as the new PM promises to introduce an Australian style points-based system</h2>

Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18, was released on Tuesday from the South Texas Detention Facility in Pearsall, after being detained on June 27. He has revealed that he lost 26 pounds during his time in ICE custody because officers didn't provide him with enough food. Francisco added that he wasn't allowed to shower and that his skin was left dry and dirty. He said the conditions were so bad that he almost asked to be self-deported.   US citizen Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18 (pictured), who was wrongly detained was released from ICE custody at the South Texas Detention Facility in Pearsall on Tuesday The teenager seen here in a picture posted on Facebook on June 17, ten days before being detained, says he lost 26 pounds during his time in ICE custody Francisco (pictured) was kept in custody due in part to an inaccurate US travel visa obtained by his mother that falsely stated he was born in Mexico He had been detained at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias along with his brother, 17-year-old Marlon Galicia, who was born in Mexico, while en route to Ranger College in North Texas on June 27. According to Francisco, he  and 60 other men were crammed into an overcrowded holding area where they slept on the floor and were given only aluminum-foil blankets.  Some even had to sleep on the restroom area floor and ticks were common, with some of the men being bitten. This left some very sick but many were afraid to ask to go to the doctor because CBP officers told them their stay would start over if they did, he claimed. Francisco said: 'It was inhumane how they treated us. It got to the point where I was ready to sign a deportation paper just to not be suffering there anymore. I just needed to get out of there.' He was speaking to the Dallas Morning News a day after hid release.    Francisco (pictured) had been detained at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias along with his brother, 17-year-old Marlon Galicia, who was born in Mexico, while en route to Ranger College in North Texas on June 27 The US citizen (pictured before the detention) said he wasn't allowed to shower and that his skin was left dry and dirty during his stint in the detainment center Francisco said he met people from all over: Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Colombians. He added: 'It's one thing to see these conditions on TV and in the news. It's another to go through them.' Francisco and his brother were with a group traveling to a soccer scouting event. He was detained after failing to produce a US passport, while he showed officials his Texas state ID, the boys' mother, Sanjuana Galicia, told The Dallas Morning News. His attorney, Claudia Galan, said she believes Francisco was 'absolutely' a victim of racial profiling. The others in the vehicle with him were all Latinos.  Francisco was kept in custody due in part to an inaccurate US travel visa obtained by his mother that falsely stated he was born in Mexico, according to the Washington Post.  The boys were with a group traveling to a soccer scouting event when Francisco was detained after failing to produce a US passport, while he showed officials his Texas state ID, the boys' mother, Sanjuana Galicia, said. Upon his release, Francisco (right) was met by his attorney, Claudia Galan (left)  Sanjuana said Francisco was denied access to a phone while in CBP custody and could not reach her until Saturday by making collect calls after he was transferred to ICE custody.   Francisco was detained by Border Patrol for well beyond the 72 hours that CBP says it is supposed to hold detainees. But in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, where Francisco was arrested, the Border Patrol is holding hundreds of adult men and women accused of entering the country illegally for longer than 72 hours.  In McAllen, Texas, adult men are being held in fenced-in pens. Vice President Mike Pence visited those pens this month, and reports and video of conditions there sparked outrage.  Francisco's brother, Marlon, was released two days after being detained after he signed a voluntary deportation form, and is now staying in Reynosa, Mexico with his grandmother.  'I signed because I wanted to talk with my mom,' Marlon said.  Galan (left) said she believes Francisco (right) was 'absolutely' a victim of racial profiling. The others in the vehicle with him were all Latinos Once Francisco was able to speak with her on the phone, Sanjuana said Francisco told her that he showed authorities his Texas state ID, which can only be obtained by a person who has a US social security number. Galan said he also had his social security card and wallet-sized birth certificate document, according to the Post.  'He's been here all his life,' Galan said, but 'when Border Patrol checked his documents, they just didn't believe they were real. They kept telling him they were fake.' Sanjuana said her older son was detained in part for not having a US passport on him, despite being a US citizen and traveling from and to destinations completely contained within the US. Immigration authorities are not supposed to detain U.S. citizens. But both ICE and CBP have apprehended citizens in the past. Sanjuana said her older son was detained in part for not having a US passport on him, despite being a US citizen and traveling from and to destinations completely contained within the US (intended route and detention point show). Officials then later became confused by a record that falsely showed Francisco was born in Mexico. Sanjuana told the Washington Post that she obtained an inaccurate US travel visa for Francisco when he was a minor that stated he was born in Mexico because she couldn't get a passport for him, and saw it as the only way he could travel across the US-Mexico border to visit with family A 2018 investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that ICE had released more than 1,480 people after investigating their citizenship status. In one case, a U.S. citizen was held in immigration detention for more than three years. Last week, a California congresswoman visiting the Border Patrol's processing center in McAllen, Texas encountered a 13-year-old girl holding a U.S. passport. The girl was waiting with her mother, who had allegedly crossed the border illegally. After inquiries were made, the Border Patrol released both. In Francisco's case, after the improper detention, officials then later became confused by a record that falsely showed Francisco was born in Mexico.  Sanjuana told the Post that she obtained an inaccurate US travel visa for Francisco when he was a minor that stated he was born in Mexico because she couldn't get a passport for him, and saw it as the only way he could travel across the US-Mexico border to visit with family. Sanjuana, who is not a US citizen, said she couldn't get him a passport because she gave a different name for herself on his birth certificate.  A copy of Francisco's birth certificate reviewed by The Dallas Morning News showed he was born at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas on December 24, 2000.  Sanjuana also provided a congratulatory certificate she received from the staff at the hospital following his birth, his health insurance card and a high school ID. Sanjuana said she brought Francisco's documentation to CBP officials last week, but it did nothing to free her son.   Francisco was last being held at the South Texas Detention Facility (pictured) in Pearsall, Texas Galan said she also explained the inaccurate US travel visa to authorities, to no avail.  'I presented them with his original birth certificate and other documents and they ignored them,' Galan said. Galan said she then faxed over all the documents to the ICE agent handling the case. Galan said while she was working intently to get Francisco freed, he was in constant fear of being deported that he has refused to sign anything without her being present. Although he speaks English, Galan said he feared they were 'going to trick him into signing a removal order' and that he would 'end up getting deported.'  The Border Patrol apprehends people entering the U.S. illegally, both directly at the U.S.-Mexico border and with its series of highway checkpoints miles from the border.  In most cases, agents glance at drivers passing through the checkpoints and let them pass quickly. A passport or proof of citizenship is not normally demanded to pass through an inland checkpoint.  The Falfurrias checkpoint is located about an hour north of the Texas-Mexico border.","<h2>US citizen, 18, 'lost 26 POUNDS because he was starved of food and wasn't allowed to shower' while he was wrongly held at the border for four weeks</h2>"

The decision makes inconsequential a ruling by Washington D.C. District Judge Timothy Kelly earlier in the day that declined to block the rule in a different lawsuit brought by immigration advocacy groups, lawyers said. The Trump administration had been quick to celebrate that decision, saying it would discourage abuse of the asylum process. Scroll down for video  A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a new rule that aimed to bar almost all asylum applications at the U.S.-Mexico border Central American migrant families recently released from federal detention wait to board a bus at a bus depot in McAllen, Texas on Friday. U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday A man begs and prays not to be taken away by Mexican immigration authorities as he holds his child, during a raid on a migrant caravan that had earlier crossed the Mexico - Guatemala border, near the city of Metapa in the state of Chiapas, Mexico on June 5. A district judge's Wednesday ruling blocks the Trump administration's order requiring asylum-seekers to first pursue safe haven in countries they traveled through on their way to the U.S. The Trump administration has sought to curtail the increasing numbers of mostly Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. -Mexico border after fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador Following the action by the San Francisco court, the rule will now be suspended pending further proceedings. 'Today's ruling is an important victory for incredibly vulnerable individuals and families,' said Melissa Crow, an attorney from the Southern Poverty Law Center - one of the groups challenging the ban - in a statement. The Trump administration has sought to curtail the increasing numbers of mostly Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. -Mexico border after fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. It has characterized the vast majority of their asylum claims as bogus. After the White House announced the rule on July 16, the American Civil Liberties Union and other rights groups sued in California on the grounds it violates U.S. law that welcomes those who come to the United States fleeing persecution at home. The Trump administration has characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as bogus from migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border as bogus Immigration is shaping up to be a focus of the presidential campaign again in 2020. In the 2016 election, voters rewarded then-candidate Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, sending him to the White House after he promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In an hour-long hearing in California, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar (pictured) said he was struck by the dangers faced by people passing through Mexico, which was significant because the Trump administration argued that country was a safe haven Opponents of the new rule contend the United States cannot force migrants to first apply for asylum in another country, such as Mexico or Guatemala, unless Washington first has a 'safe third country' agreement with that government. Both Mexico and Guatemala have resisted Trump administration efforts to reach such a deal. In an hour-long hearing in California, Tigar said he was struck by the dangers faced by people passing through Mexico, which was significant because the Trump administration argued that country was a safe haven. 'The administrative record about the dangers faced by persons transiting through Mexico and the inadequacy of the asylum system there ... is stunning,' Tigar said from bench. Tigar in November struck down a different asylum ban that attempted to block all migrants crossing illegally from asking for refuge in the United States. The Trump administration has issued a rapid-fire series of anti-immigration edicts recently. Last week, the administration issued another rule to expedite deportations for immigrants who have crossed illegally within the last two years and are caught anywhere in the United States. The rule eliminated a level of judicial review and expanded a program typically applied only along the southern border with Mexico. Democrats have blasted the policies as cruel, faulting the Trump administration for warehousing migrants in crowded detention facilities along the border and separating immigrant children from the adults they have traveled with.",<h2>Judge BLOCKS Trump's asylum rule that aimed to bar almost all asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border</h2>

61,7277709," Published: 19:15 BST, 23 July 2019 ","Judicial Watch, a conservative activist group, filed an ethics complaint against Representative Ilhan Omar for accusations that she married her brother to commit immigration fraud, among other crimes. A new report, following a three year investigation, alleged that Omar married her biological brother, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, in 2009 to benefit in some fraudulent way from the marriage. Omar is a Somali-Ameriacan immigrant who fled Africa for the U.S. with her family when she was a young girl. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen when she was 17. The report alleges that her second husband, Elmi – who she supposedly married when she was still married to her first husband – is actually her brother. Following the report, and Donald Trump's mentioned of the unsubstantiated evidence, Judicial Watch filed a complaint calling for the House Office of Congressional Ethics to launch a full investigation into the congresswoman's crimes. Conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch filed a complaint to the Office of Congressional Ethics to open an investigation into alleged crimes by Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar (pictured), including marrying her brother to commit immigration fraud 'The evidence is overwhelming Rep. Omar may have violated the law and House rules,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton wrote in a letter. 'The House of Representatives must urgently investigate and resolve the serious allegations of wrongdoing by Rep. Omar' 'The evidence is overwhelming Rep. Omar may have violated the law and House rules,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton wrote in a letter to Office of Congressional Ethics Chairman David Skaggs. 'The House of Representatives must urgently investigate and resolve the serious allegations of wrongdoing by Rep. Omar,' Fitton continued. 'We encourage Americans to share their views on Rep. Omar's apparent misconduct with their congressmen.' Judicial Watch, which files Freedom of Information Act lawsuits to investigate claimed misconduct by government officials, is requesting the congressional oversight group look at all the alleged crimes outlined in an in-depth investigative report from reporters David Steinberg, Preya Samsundar and Scott Johnson on Powerline blog. Among the crimes are immigration fraud, which the report claims Omar participated in when marrying Elmi in order for him to obtain U.S. citizenship and emigrate to America from the U.K. – where he is a longtime citizen. The fraud scheme includes another level in that it aided Elmi to obtain federal student loans in attending North Dakota State University, which he would not have been able to obtain if he weren't a citizen through marriage. Omar and Elmi divorced in 2017, and as part of the divoce, the report revealed that Omar submitted an 'Application for an Order for Service by Alternative Means' in Minnesota.  A three-year investigation alleges Omar married her brother Ahmed Nur Said Elmi so he could emigrate to the U.S. and obtain federal student loans to attend school in North Dakota Omar married Elmi in 2009, before she had divorced her first husband. The report reveals that Elmi is actually her biological brother. The two divorced in 2017, but Omar claimed she had not seen him since June 2011 Photo evidence, however, suggests Omar may have perjured herself by signing a document claiming she had not seen Elmi. Instagram evidence shows them in an image together in 2015 In the document, the now-Minnesota representative claimed she had not had contact with Elmi after June 2011 and did not know where to find him.  By signing the document, Omar was swearing to the state that 'under penalty of perjury that everything I have stated in this document is true and correct.' However, Steinberg, Samsunder and Johnson's investigation revealed, with Instagram photo evidence, that Omar and Elmi had met up in London in 2015. 'The facts describe perhaps the most extensive spree of illegal misconduct committed by a House member in American history,' Steineberg alleged. Judicial Watch claims it is a 'non-partisan educational foundation.' While speaking with reporters last week, Trump briefly talked about the report on Omar, which brought more attention to the alleged crimes and the fact the progressive representative likely married her brother. 'There's a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother. I know nothing about it,' Trump said before departing the White House last Wednesday. 'I'm sure that somebody would be looking at that.' The issued garnered more momentum after Donald Trump made mention of the issue during a White House departure last week, saying 'I know nothing about it...  I'm sure that somebody would be looking at that' Trump has been in a war of words with Omar and the rest of the progressive group of minority representative who call themselves 'the squad.'

On July 14, Trump told Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley to 'go back' and fix their countries of origin before wading into U.S. government. The comments were widely viewed as 'racist,' but the president continued to repeat similar sentiments – like telling people if they don't like America, they can leave, and claiming the four congresswomen are 'not capable' of loving the U.S. The lawmakers – who were all elected to the House in the 2018 midterm elections – held a press conference last Monday to condemn Trump's words and call for his impeachment.

Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18, was detained at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias along with his brother, 17-year-old Marlon Galicia, who was born in Mexico, while en route to Ranger College in North Texas on June 27. The boys were with a group traveling to a soccer scouting event when Francisco was detained after failing to produce a US passport, while he showed officials his Texas state ID, the boys' mother, Sanjuana Galicia, told The Dallas Morning News. He was kept in custody due in part to an inaccurate US travel visa obtained by his mother that falsely stated he was born in Mexico, according to the Washington Post.  Sanjuana said Francisco was denied access to a phone while in CBP custody and could not reach her until Saturday by making collect calls after he was transferred to ICE custody.  Francisco's attorney, Claudia Galan, said: 'He’s going on a full month of being wrongfully detained. He’s a U.S. citizen and he needs to be released now.'  Marlon was released two days after being detained after he signed a voluntary deportation form, and is now staying in Reynosa, Mexico with his grandmother.   US citizen Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18 (pictured), was detained at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias along with his brother, 17-year-old Marlon Galicia, who was born in Mexico, while en route to a soccer scouting event at Ranger College in North Texas on June 27 'I signed because I wanted to talk with my mom. Now, we just have to wait and see and hope that they release my brother,' Marlon said.  Once he was able to speak with her on the phone, Sanjuana said Francisco told her that he showed authorities his Texas state ID, which can only be obtained by a person who has a US social security number. Galan said he also had his social security card and wallet-sized birth certificate document, according to the Post.  'He’s been here all his life,' Galan said, but 'when Border Patrol checked his documents, they just didn’t believe they were real. They kept telling him they were fake.' Sanjuana said her older son was detained in part for not having a US passport on him, despite being a US citizen and traveling from and to destinations completely contained within the US. Officials then later became confused by a record that falsely showed Francisco was born in Mexico. Sanjuana told the Post that she obtained an inaccurate US travel visa for Francisco when he was a minor that stated he was born in Mexico because she couldn't get a passport for him, and saw it as the only way he could travel across the US-Mexico border to visit with family. Sanjuana, who is not a US citizen, said she couldn't get him a passport because she gave a different name for herself on his birth certificate.  Sanjuana said her older son was detained in part for not having a US passport on him, despite being a US citizen and traveling from and to destinations completely contained within the US (intended route and detention point show).

The highly publicized raids, which were touted by President Donald Trump, had targeted 2,105 individuals in a dozen cities with final orders of deportation issued by a court.  But the publicity and early warnings from activists who issued advice on how to evade ICE agents likely prompted many who were targeted for removal to go into hiding.  'I don't know of any other population where people are telling them how to avoid arrest as a result of illegal activity,' Matthew Albence, the acting director of ICE, told the New York Times, which reported the arrest numbers. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detain a man during an operation in Escondido, California earlier this month. Raids targeting some 2,000 people with final orders of deportation seem to have fizzled with just 35 arrests resulting  The raids were originally scheduled for June, but were postponed by Trump at the last minute until July 14. The raids were similar to prior enforcement actions under other administrations, both Republican and Democrat, except for the hype and publicity around them, promoted in no small part by Trump himself. Activists and politicians responded by sounding the alarm and urging illegal immigrants to refuse to open the door if ICE agents knocked. The advice was spread by local activists and national politicians including Hillary Clinton, as well as the members of the progressive 'squad' of House Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.  'It certainly makes it harder for us to effectuate these orders issued,' Albence said of advice on how to evade arrest.  'You didn't hear ICE talking about it before the operation was taking place,' he added.  Protesters march to offices of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on July 13in Chicago. Widespread publicity about the raids is believed to have limited their effectiveness  The Trump administration has so far deported fewer people on average each year than the Obama administration. In fiscal year 2018, the Trump administration deported 256,086 immigrants, an increase of 13 percent over the previous year. Former President Barack Obama removed 409,849 people in 2012, an all-time high, and 235,413 in fiscal year 2015. In the first two quarters of the 2019 fiscal year, the Trump administration deported 130,432 people, up from 123,253 during the same period the previous year.  During the same time period, 361,308 people were apprehended crossing the southern border illegally, many of whom will be allowed to remain in the U.S. indefinitely. ","<h2>ICE arrested only 35 people out of 2,000 targeted in Trump’s highly publicized raids because migrants with final deportation orders knew ahead of time not to be at home</h2>"
65,7275691," Published: 11:40 BST, 23 July 2019 ","A campaign group for 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK today launched a legal challenge against the new 'immigration exemption' to data protection rules. The3million argue that the exemption introduced in last year's Data Protection Act will deny EU citizens access to their personal records in immigration cases. The group believe that the exemption is unlawful and will prevent the 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK, who will have to apply for a new immigration status post Brexit, from challenging errors made by the Home Office. The case on behalf of 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK is set to be heard at the High Court They claim that EU citizens will need access to their personal records to prove that they are entitled to live in the UK. They also believe that this access will enable EU citizens to correct any mistakes made by agencies in their application process that, if left uncorrected, could have disastrous consequences for them. The restriction is said to be available to all data controllers, including schools, doctors, local authorities or employers who could restrict EU citizens' access to their data while continuing to share it with the Government for immigration enforcement. They argue that the exemption is unlawful because it undermines an individual's right to privacy and are seeking that the exemption is removed, or restricted in its scope. The case, against the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, is also being brought by digital campaigners Open Rights Group, and is supported by legal campaign group Liberty. The organisations previously urged the Government to reconsider the exemption before it became law and launched High Court proceedings after it refused to do so. Ben Jaffey, QC, acting on behalf of both organisations told the High Court that post-Brexit a further 5 per cent of the UK's total population, namely EU citizens, will now be subject to immigration arrangements currently extended to non EU citizens. He said: 'There will be a further three million people who are EU citizens who will be subject to these arrangements. 'A further 5 per cent of all those who live in the UK. The immigration exemption as drafted applies to both the public and private sector. 'It contains a pretty broad conception of exemption.' He acknowledged that the immigration exemption has an exception for the right of EU citizens to correct data about themselves. But he maintained that without knowing what data the Home Office holds, or who it is sharing that data with, the right to correct is meaningless. 'You need to know what data the Home Office holds and who it is sharing it with to know what to rectify', he said. Mr Jaffey told the court that the position of the Home Office until now was that it did not need to tell people when the immigration exemption was being applied. 'The position up until now was that the Home Office did not tell people when the immigration exemption was being applied at all.' He said there was a low test threshold for application of the immigration exemption. 'The test is whether it is likely to prejudice effective immigration control', he said. He added that those who the exemption applies to are vulnerable members of society. 'It will normally be used in relation to people caught up in the immigration system', he said. 'Who are more likely to be unable to speak English and who are being asked to navigate a complex area of law, in an area where decisions have very serious consequences.' Mr Jaffey told the court that a significant percentage of the data held by the Home Office is wrong. He said the immigration exemption will make it impossible for EU citizens to challenge data that is wrong about them. 'We know that a significant percentage of the data held by the home office is wrong', he said. He added: 'You can't challenge, in essence, what you don't know about.' The QC proposed a test of 'strict necessity' to be applied by the government while deciding when the exemption applies. This would require the government to have a 'good reason' for applying the exemption. 'It must be narrow', he said. 'No wiggle room or scope for mission creep. 'The user of the data will get permission for that use only, no blank cheques.' Mr Jaffey said the defendant, namely the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, has been careful not to provide a full list of potential uses of the immigration exemption. He claimed that this is because a broad exemption, also known in legal terms as a broad derogation, is convenient to them. 'The defendant has been careful not to provide a full list of potential uses', he said. 'It is very obvious why the government likes broad derogation. 'It gives maximum scope and is quite convenient. Which is precisely why they are anathema to strict necessity.' The Home Office contend the exemption is compatible with EU data regulations and charter rights. Hugh Tomlinson, on behalf of Liberty, said the immigration exemption would lead to untrained data controllers such as landlords and employers recording information about EU citizens. This data could in turn impact their future immigration status. It would then also leave those same EU citizens unable to check if their employer or landlord has recorded a mistake about them. 'The idea that private landlords or employers are in a position to carry out a proportionate analysis is, we would say, fanciful,' he said. 'Effective immigration control is an important measure and it affects many millions of people. 'If a landlord or a bank or an employer incorrectly records something about a data holder that makes them liable to the home office about their immigration status the data holder may have no means to correct it. 'These data controllers may or may not have any data training or data experience.' Christopher Knight, on behalf of the Information Commissioner, said the immigration exemption was already being used by the Home Office in 60 per cent of subject access requests. 'In the Home Office the exemption has already been relied upon in some 60 per cent of subject access requests. We allow that in a number of these cases it will only be used to redact some information, not all of it.' Leigh Day solicitor Rosa Curling said: 'The discriminatory, two-tier data protection regime created by our Government is unlawful and we hope the court will agree it must be reconsidered on an urgent basis. 'Individuals must have access to their personal data so they know what information is held about them by the Home Office and others, how this information is being processed and shared and to allow them to correct any errors made. 'Without access to the data, their right to rectify is meaningless.'  The hearing continues. ","<h2>Campaigners launch battle to protect Britain's 3.6m EU citizens from new 'immigration exemption' that means schools, doctors and bosses could BLOCK their access to data after Brexit</h2>"

At the time, she'd already had two children with Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi and had been married and divorced from him in sharia law but their union was never legally recognized.  According to internet sleuths, Omar, Elmi and Hirsi all lived together in Fargo, where both she and Elmi studied at North Dakota State University.  In 2011, Elmi moved to London (he is a British citizen of Somali descent), Omar and Hirsi got back together and had their third child a year later.  What became of Elmi afterwards has remained somewhat of a mystery. Omar claimed in 2016, when the rumor that they were related emerged online and denied it as 'absurd and offensive', that he moved to the UK in 2011.  But photographs obtained by DailyMail.com prove he was in the US, in Minneapolis (the town where they got married), until 2012.  Elmi's profile in the UK begins in 2013 when he started working as a public relations assistant that year, then went on to dabble in fashion writing.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is demanding a '9/11-style commission' to look into the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border. Speaking at her first town hall meeting since Donald Trump exhorted her House 'squad' to 'go back' where they came from, the New York Democrat said Saturday that the president was 'racist' and was stoking white supremacy in the US. The liberal firebrand told the town hall in Queens that the US had a 'lifelong commitment' to migrant children separated from the parents under the policy, adding that it 'will take a 9/11-style commission.' 'We need a commission on child separation,' she added.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez holds an immigration Town Hall In Queens on Saturday The 9/11 commission was set up on November 27, 2002, 'to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks.' AOC is demanding a similar account of the migrant border policies.  But the congresswoman's comparison of the child separation policy to the World Trade Center terror attacks has been criticized by  the Republican National Committee. RNC spokesperson Liz Harrington told the New York Post that the statement was 'anti-American'. 'Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's divisive rhetoric never ends,' she said. 'If the Democrats truly cared about addressing the crisis on the border, they would fix the loopholes in our immigration laws,' Harrington added.  AOC also disparaged Trump's account of his Wednesday night rally in North Carolina where the crowd chanted to send Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., back to her native country.  The rising liberal star said the president had 'relished' the chants, which came just days after he suggested that Omar, AOC and two other women of color Democrats should 'go back to their own countries.'  'He kind of presided over the situation, he relished it, he took it in,' she said, adding that she believed he had egged them on.   She also dismissed Trump's claims he tried to stop the chants 'immediately.'  'Roll the tape, he didn't,' she said.  Trump tweeted Saturday he did 'nothing to lead people on.' 'Nor was I particularly happy with their chant. Just a very big and patriotic crowd.' The remarks came a week after Trump ignited controversy with tweets about Rep. Omar of Minnesota, who moved from Somalia as a child, and her colleagues Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. 'Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done,' Trump tweeted. At the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that the remarks proved the true motivation behind Trump's stance on immigration.  'This tells you that this president's policies are not about immigration, it's about ethnicity and racism,' she said. 'We do not have to acquiesce to the president's racism, because he is using racism, he is stoking white supremacy, and he is allowing frankly neo-Nazi groups to go off unchecked because that is a key part of rousing his base,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'We cannot allow and give into that,' she continued. On Friday, Trump reversed his previous criticisms of a North Carolina campaign crowd that chanted 'send her back' this week about Omar. Trump on defended the rally-goers as 'patriots' while again questioning the loyalty of four Democrats. When reporters at the White House asked if he was unhappy with the Wednesday night crowd, Trump responded: 'Those are incredible people. They are incredible patriots. But I'm unhappy when a congresswoman goes and says, 'I'm going to be the president's nightmare.''  'You can't talk that way about our country. Not when I'm president,' Trump said. 'These women have said horrible things about our country and the people of our country.'

Omar was defiant after the rally, telling reporters at the Capitol that she believes the president is a 'fascist' and casting the confrontation as a fight over 'what this country truly should be.' 'We are going to continue to be a nightmare to this president because his policies are a nightmare to us. We are not deterred. We are not frightened,' she told a cheering crowd that greeted her like a local hero at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport as she returned from Washington. ",<h2>AOC demands a 9/11-style commission into Trump's border policy and claims the president 'relished' the anti-Omar 'send her back' rally chant - but GOP leaders slam her 'divisive rhetoric'</h2>

Wax, the Robert Mundheim Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania, made her remarks at the Edmund Burke Foundation's National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. that took place on Sunday through Tuesday.  A full transcript of her remarks - made during a panel called 'American Greatness and Immigration: The Case for Low and Slow' - were not available online, but was covered in extensive pieces from Buzzfeed and Vox.  'Conservatives need a realistic approach to immigration that ... preserves the United States as a Western and First World nation,' she said on the panel.  'We are better off if we are dominated numerically ... by people from the First World, from the West, than by people who are from less advanced countries.'  She referenced a 2018 paper that argued for immigration based on ethnonational background.  At one point she said: 'Embracing cultural distance, cultural distance nationalism means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites'  'Europe and the first world to which the United States belongs remain mostly white for now, and the third world, although mixed, contains a lot of nonwhite people,' Wax also stated.  'Embracing cultural distance, cultural distance nationalism means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites. Well, that is the result, anyway.  'So even if our immigration philosophy is grounded firmly in cultural concerns doesn't rely on race at all, and no matter how many times we repeat the mantra that correlation is not causation, these racial dimensions are enough to spook conservatives. As a result today we have an immigration policy driven by fear.'  Wax was immediately blasted with criticism on twitter from Penn alums along with Law professors from other schools who added that she had a history of incendiary comments about minorities.  The Latinx Law Students Association - along with other organizations at the university -released a petition demanding a number of actions take place in regards to Wax's 'racist' comments.   The Latinx Law Students Association - along with other organizations at the university -released a petition demanding a number of actions take place in regards to Wax's 'racist' comments They asked that Penn Law denounce her statements, develop an action plan to adequately train personnel on sensitivity training, relieve Wax of her teaching duties, hire more professors of color and for a meeting with Dean Ruger at the beginning of the year.   'At Penn Law, diversity should not be a conversation that only emerges when Professor Wax uses the cover of her tenure to spew racist, anti-intellectual comments,' the petition reads. 'Diversity should be an ongoing dialogue that gains momentum through administration-sponsored events and a fully-developed diversity action plan that our classmates demanded two years ago.' It later adds: 'Professor Wax may believe she has the ability to demean the very students she teaches without consequence, but Penn collegiality should mean that the law school upholds its values of diversity and inclusion to make all students feel welcome—regardless of their heritage and immigration status.'

On July 3 after midnight, Heydi Gámez García was found hanging from her bedroom closet with a phone-charging cable tied around her neck by her aunt, Zoila Gámez,  wanted to cheer her up with a snack and a refreshment. She was declared brain dead a week later.  The young girl's father, Manuel Gámez, 34, received a special parole permit from U.S. immigration officials last week after he was arrested for illegally crossing the border in June.  The distraught parent arrived last Saturday at Newark International Airport to be with his daughter and said he spent his last days with her reading her the bible and singing her biblical hymns.  'And I know she listened to me because her face changed and there were tears in her eyes,' Manuel told reporters Thursday. 'We are going to donate the organs so that she can live through other people. I don’t want her to remember that way in that bed in a coma, connected to those hoses, to that machine. I want to imagine her running, playing.' Manuel Gámez looks over his daughter Heydi Gámez García, who attempted to end her life July 3. On Thursday, the Honduran father gave doctors at a New York City hospital the approval to disconnect her from life support after she had been declared brain dead Heydi was granted asylum in June 2016, a year after she entered the United States Manuel Gámez told DailyMail 'the hardest moments are coming' just hours before he made the difficult decision of unplugging his daughter from life support Heydi arrived in the United States as a nine-year-old in the summer of 2015, a year after Manuel had to travel back to his hometown of El Progreso after his father, who along with Manuel's mother were raising the child, was murdered in June 2014 by gang members who want him to hand over his SUV. Manuel's mother, who was caring for Heydi while he lived and worked in New York as an undocumented immigrant, succumbed to a battle with diabetes in 2015 , which drove him to making the decision of sending Heydi and his sister Zoila, who at the time was underage, to live with his four other siblings in New York, because he considered their Central American nation to be too dangerous a place for the girls to be raised. The decision kept the father and daughter separated for four years and when they were finally reunited, it's all too late. 'This is the hardest thing for a man, to know that the most important thing in life is going away,' Manuel told Univision.  'I promised her we were going to be together. I think she lost hope that I was going to be with her. It was never my intention to leave her alone.'  The young girl had been battling bouts of depression over the last couple of months after she celebrated her 13th birthday in March. ""I am very sad, really depressed,' the distraught Honduran dad told DailyMail over the phone on Thursday afternoon.  'The hardest moments are coming.' Zoila recalled that Heydi would shield herself in her bedroom whenever she was saddened over how the Trump administration's immigration position further distanced her from her dad, especially after her mother abandoned her when she was just two years of age. Her other aunt, Jessica Gámez, tried to fault herself for her niece's suicide attempt. 'I do feel that I didn’t know how to take good care of her. I do feel that I failed her,' she said. Paramedics transported Heydi was to Cohen Children's Medical Center where doctors sadly declared her brain-dead a week later. Family lawyer Anibal Romero blamed the Trump administrations asylum posture as one of the main reasons why Heydi tried to end her life. 'Words matter, tweets matter,' Romero told DailyMail on Thursday. 'When the president threatens to deport millions of people, it really causes anxiety, causes fear, especially in children who are afraid of losing their parents. Politicians should be very careful with the words that are used. It doesn’t matter that it’s on social networks. ... Today it’s Heydi, tomorrow it will be someone else.' Jessica Gámez faults herself after he 13-year-old niece, Heydi Gámez García, hung herself from a door because she was saddened over her father's plight with the Trump administration's immigration policies Heydi Gámez García lost hope that she would be reunited with her father after he was arrested while trying to enter the United States in June, almost three months after her 13th birthday Heydi (left) arrived to the United States in 2015 and spent only two months at a shelter for migrant minors before she was released to her aunt Jessica (right) Heydi make it across the Mexico-United States border in July 2015. She was granted asylum in June 2016 by the U.S. government, which awarded permanent residency in the United States, and quickly picked up on the English language. That same year Manuel attempted to cross the border but was arrested by the Border Patrol in McAllen, Texas. He was intercepted once again in September 2017 by immigration agents near Santa Teresa, N.M. he tried to enter the country and was convicted of illegally re-entering and was sentenced to 45 days in prison before he was deported to Honduras in November.  Amidst pleas from his daughter to be reconnected again - she was even giving him English lessons through video calls - Manuel promised his distraught daughter he would once again try to evade the strict border measures in March. A saddened Heydi Gámez Garcia kept to herself in a bedroom and was found shortly after midnight July 3 hanging from a closet Zoila Gámez was looking to cheer up her niece when she walked into the bedroom and found her with a phone-charging cord tied around her neck The determined parent made it to Mexico in early June and gave his daughter the heads up that he was on his way back to New York. Manuel told his daughter that as soon as he made it to Houston it would just take him about a week before they would be together. 'It has been difficult to be away from her,' Manuel said. 'As a father you always want to be with your children. I was hoping to be with her again.' But just like the previous other times, his path to reuniting with Heydi was once again blocked.  On July 13, Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed through with a request from Romero, who was assisted by Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and gave Manuel permission to travel from the holding facility in Texas to be with his daughter - just a few years too late. Manuel shared of photo collage of his daughter along with a heartbreaking caption on his Facebook account Wednesday morning. 'It will be difficult to accept your departure, my princess, with the hope that in heaven you will be a little angel of God and that you will give me strength when I can't continue without you, my love.' Heydi is slated to be buried next Tuesday before Manuel flies to Houston to turn himself in. An immigration judge will decide his fate shortly thereafter. Romero hopes immigration officials would grant him a chance to prove his asylum case. 'This is a man who is completely emotionally destroyed, and locking him in a prison would kill him,' Romero said.  'Apart from that, if the government deported him, his life is at risk in Honduras and a tragedy could become another tragedy.'   ","<h2>'It really causes fear, especially in children who are afraid of losing their parents': Lawyer for family of Honduran teen girl who hanged herself in NYC because ICE blocked her dad's entry for a fourth time hits out at 'the words Trump uses'</h2>"

It comes after the US president sparked a racism row when he sent tweets telling four female Democratic politicians to 'go back' to the countries from which they came. The president is facing widespread condemnation over comments widely perceived to be about outspoken critic Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and three other female politicians, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.  Only Ms Omar, from Somalia, is foreign-born, and she has lived in the US since arriving as a 10-year-old refugee in 1992.    His tweets were followed by a crowd at one his his rallies chanting 'send her back' about Mrs Omar, one of his fiercest critics.  In his speech today in London Mr Javid said: 'I'm from an immigrant family, I know what it's like to be told to go back to where I came from – and I don't think they mean Rochdale. In a speech today, Sajid Javid is expected to call for an honest 'national conversation' about extremism and challenge anti-immigration rhetoric, which he says is stoking division and fear 'To be truly pro-immigration we must be pro-integration too. 'To do this, we must confront the myths about immigration that extremists use to drive divisions. 'We know the scale is exaggerated to stoke up fear and that they use immigration as a proxy for race. 'Sweeping plans to cut immigration as if it's automatically bad can add to the stigma.'     Mr Javid outlined a three-pronged approach of tackling extremism - confronting narratives, strengthening communities' resilience and tackling causes of confronting extremist narratives - in what is being touted as one of the first major interventions since the Counter Extremism Strategy was launched in 2015. He used the speech to attack the London-based CAGE group, which campaigns for an 'end to the war on terror'. He said it is one of the most prominent organisations that 'rejects our shared values' and promised to revoke its licence to sponsor people coming into the country. He also called for further integration within society, more help for people to learn English, greater support for communities and a celebration of national identity. He said: 'Everyone has a part to play; broadcasters who must not give a platform to extremists, police who must swoop on the worst offenders and public figures who must moderate their language. 'And anyone can challenge the myths peddled by extremists that deepen divisions. 'So tell your friends, shout it loud and proud, people from minority backgrounds did not steal our jobs, they're not terrorists and that there is no global ''Zionist conspiracy''.

'Public discourse is hardening and becoming less constructive. 'Everyone has a part to play: broadcasters who must not give a platform to extremists; police who must swoop on the worst offenders; public figures who must moderate their language.' The speech took place following the publication of a poll carried out by the independent Commission for Countering Extremism, which is working on a review of the threat and response to extremism in England and Wales.

Of those, 59 per cent said they had seen Islamist extremism, 37 per cent far right extremism and 29 per cent far left extremism. Speaking ahead of the Home Secretary's speech entitled Confronting Extremism Together, lead commissioner Sara Khan said: 'I was shocked to see that more than half of the respondents have witnessed extremism in some way, and that two-fifths of those that had witnessed it said they'd seen it in their local area. 'The findings underline the breadth and severity of the concerns we have in 2019. 'People are scared that violent extremists will incite or carry out an attack.

75,7263069," Published: 23:56 BST, 18 July 2019 ","Lots of people have bent over backwards to give President Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt. It was always clear to all except his most blinkered admirers that he is an obnoxious man, a bully and a misogynist.  But reasonable observers could see that he had tapped into the fears of many people about uncontrolled immigration and the dire effects of globalisation. The horrid truth is that one has to go back to the Fascist demagogues of the 1930s in Germany and Italy to find politicians eager to whip up supporters in a comparable way. President Trump is pictured at a rally on Wednesday night So whenever those on the Left accused him of Fascism, I felt they were concentrating on the disagreeable aspects of his personality without conceding that he speaks for tens of millions of decent people in America – and no doubt in this country, too. Moreover, he is the Leader of the Free World, and the President of our closest ally, so it seemed there was nothing to be gained, and almost certainly much to be lost, in covering this famously thin-skinned man with abuse. But after his latest outrage – stoking an hysterical crowd into chanting ‘SEND HER BACK’, in reference to an elected US congresswoman of Somali origin – it’s no longer possible to mount any kind of respectable defence of Donald Trump. His latest outburst has thrown the United States into a new sphere of febrile populist politics – which why it is shameful that only a handful of Republicans have so far dared to rebuke him. This is a pivotal moment in his presidency, and no doubt in the history of his country This was as ugly as it can get in a democracy. A crowd including children at a rally in North Carolina was incited into a kind of racist hysteria by the President of the United States, some of them with raised fists. They constituted a mob – created and controlled by Trump. No previous American President could have conceivably behaved like this. Nor would any democratically elected Western leader one can think of.  The horrid truth is that one has to go back to the Fascist demagogues of the 1930s in Germany and Italy to find politicians eager to whip up supporters in a comparable way. Needless to say, I’m no fan of Ilhan Omar, the woman who was the target of the mob’s rage, and who earlier in the week Trump crudely invited to ‘go back’ home, along with three other non-white female, American-born members of the so-called ‘Squad’. Needless to say, I’m no fan of Ilhan Omar, the woman who was the target of the mob’s rage, and who earlier in the week Trump crudely invited to ‘go back’ home, along with three other non-white female, American-born members of the so-called ‘Squad’ Omar is a hard-line socialist whose hostility to Israel has led to plausible charges of anti-Semitism. She would, in fact, be perfectly at home in Jeremy Corbyn’s inner sanctum.  In the unlikely event of her ever getting close to power, she would be a disaster for her fellow Americans. However, she is an elected representative and an American citizen, who escaped a terrible civil war in Somalia before spending four years in a refugee camp in Kenya. Then she was rescued by Uncle Sam. If all Americans with foreign connections were sent back to where their immediate ancestors came from, there would be many millions of them – including Donald Trump, whose own mother was born in the Hebrides, and did not arrive in the United States until a day after her 18th birthday. Trump is really suggesting that someone who is black and foreign-born, and happens to hold views he doesn’t like, should not enjoy the same rights as ordinary Americans. In his estimation, she has inferior status. We all know the last time a populist leader sought to demonise a whole section of the population. Of course, unlike Adolf Hitler, if nothing else, he is circumscribed by the long-established apparatus of a democratic state. And, unlike the evil Nazi leader, he has not developed a coherent racist philosophy. Rather, he lashes out in destructive way because he is a deeply unpleasant and opportunistic man.  In the 2016 presidential campaign, he repeatedly called his opponent, Hillary Clinton, ‘crooked’, and delighted his followers by suggesting that she should be ‘locked up’.  It could be that by whipping up a crowd into a racist frenzy, and using racist jibes against the Squad, Trump has alienated a number of the voters without whom he cannot be re-elected President of the United States There were echoes, of course, in this week’s chants of ‘SEND HER BACK’ directed at Omar. Isn’t it interesting how his nastiness takes on an extra edge when he is attacking women?  For Trump, women are first and foremost ‘meat’ – as newly unearthed video footage taken at his Mar-a-Lago club in 1992 attests. He is shown standing next to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, pointing to one woman before saying: ‘She’s hot!’ In another scene, he grabs one young woman by the waist, as he is surrounded by a bevy of laughing girls. He is shown standing next to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, pointing to one woman before saying: ‘She’s hot!’ In another scene, he grabs one young woman by the waist, as he is surrounded by a bevy of laughing girls There’s plenty of evidence that Trump is sexist as well as racist – and by any normal standards a thoroughly disagreeable human being. His latest outburst has thrown the United States into a new sphere of febrile populist politics – which why it is shameful that only a handful of Republicans have so far dared to rebuke him. This is a pivotal moment in his presidency, and no doubt in the history of his country. Trump’s calculation is that if he develops the narrative of ungrateful, foreign-born, non-white people taking advantage of an over-indulgent America, he will energise his core support. To judge by the squalid reaction of the crowd in North Carolina, he is bang on the money. But will reasonable people of conservative disposition be swayed by Trump’s dredging the swamps of populism?  The United States is certainly a more Right-wing country than Britain, and it possible for politicians to use language there that would be considered unacceptable here. All the same, I have some faith in the good sense of most Americans to resist extremism. It could be that by whipping up a crowd into a racist frenzy, and using racist jibes against the Squad, Trump has alienated a number of the voters without whom he cannot be re-elected President of the United States. Let’s hope so. We can only pray. The events of the past few days have confirmed what many of us feared but didn’t want to believe – that this awful man is not fit to be leader of his great country and of the Free World.","<h2>STEPHEN GLOVER: After the outrage of stoking his supporters to chant 'Send her back', it's clear Donald Trump is no longer fit to lead America</h2>"

Of the 22 MS-13 gang members captured this week, 19 were found to be illegal immigrants. 'Most of the MS-13 Gang members indicted & arrested in L.A. were illegal aliens, 19 of 22,' Trump tweeted Thursday. 'They are said to have killed many people in the most brutal fashion. They should never have been allowed in our Country for so long, 10 years.' A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that 19 of the 22 suspects arrested entered the U.S. illegally over the last four years. President Donald Trump praised Immigration and Customs Enforcement for capturing 22 MS-13 members this week – 19 of which are are in the country illegally  Trump also lauded ICE for arresting and deporting thousands of gang members in general Trump also praised ICE for deporting thousands of gang members over the years. 'We have arrested and deported thousands of gang members, in particular MS-13. ICE and Border Patrol are doing a great job!' he added in a duo of tweets. The 22 men arrested are linked to several killings in the Los Angeles area – four were killed with machetes, baseball bats and knives in Angeles National Forest, and they murdered a homeless man earlier this year in North Hollywood and another in Malibu hills. In the case with the machete, members lured someone thought to be part of a rival gang into the forest. After killing the victim, they dismembered his body and cut out his heart, then dumped the body in the canyon. Assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, Paul Delacourt, said the gang members were motivated to carry out the killings to assert dominance in the area. To drum up support for the border wall, increased border security and other immigration policies, Trump often invokes some of the horrific crimes carried out by MS-13. Trump often pegs the issues at the border – and crime involving illegal immigrants – on gangs such as MS-13. Invoking their crimes to drum up support for harsher immigration policies The final capture of the 22 members, which happened over the weekend, helps conclude a two year investigation into several brutal killings MS-13 was formed in prisons in Los Angeles in the 1980s, primarily to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs. The indictment against the 22, who are part of the so-called Fulton clique of MS-13, cites seven instances where they abducted victims to kill them – sometimes stabbing them or beating them to death with baseball bats. The case 'centers on murders and medieval-style violence,' Delacourt said, adding that until this spree began, 'we haven't seen this level of violence associated with MS-13 in Southern California.' Earlier this year, Trump declared a national emergency at the border after failing to secure funding for the border wall. He said the humanitarian crisis can be attributed to human trafficking, drug smuggling and crime – much of which he attributes to gangs such as MS-13.",<h2>Trump boasts that 19 out of 22 MS-13 gangsters arrested in Los Angeles this week were 'illegal aliens' as he praises ICE for scooping up 'vicious' murderers</h2>
77,7262141," Published: 20:34 BST, 18 July 2019 ","A teenage immigrant girl from Honduras, who spent four years separated from her father, has been finally reunited with him, but it's all too late. Heydi Gámez García, 13, will be disconnected from life support at a local New York hospital Thursday evening by her father Manuel Gámez, who on Saturday arrived on  a plane after immigration officials granted him a special two-week parole to say goodbye to his daughter. ""I am very sad, really depressed,' the distraught Honduran dad told DailyMail over the phone on Thursday afternoon.  'The hardest moments are coming.' The young girl had been battling bouts of depression amidst President Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies that kept her away from her dad, who in June had been arrested after trying to reenter the United States after he was deported in 2016. On July 3 just after midnight, Heydi was found hanging from her bedroom closet with a phone-charging cable tied around her neck by her aunt who decided to cheer her up with a snack and a refreshment.  She was transported to the hospital and sadly declared brain-dead a week later. Family lawyer Anibal Romero blamed the Trump administrations asylum stance as one of the main reasons why Heydi tried to end her life. 'Words matter, tweets matter,' Romero told DailyMail on Thursday. 'When the president threatens to deport millions of people, it really causes anxiety, causes fear, especially in children who are afraid of losing their parents. Politicians should be very careful with the words that are used. It doesn’t matter that it’s on social networks. ... Today it’s Heydi, tomorrow it will be someone else.' Manuel Gámez looks over his daughter Heydi Gámez García, who attempted to end her life Heydi Gámez García lost hope that she would be reunited with her father after he was arrested while trying to enter the United States in June, almost three months after her 13th birthday The Honduran teenager had spent the last four years separated from her father. Manuel was living in the United States as an undocumented immigrant when he was forced to to fly back home to El Progreso, Honduras, in June 2014 after his father was assassinated by gang members who demanded his SUV. His mother succumbed to a battle with diabetes the following year, which drove him to making the decision of sending Heydi and her aunt Zoila, who at the time was underage, to live with his four other siblings in Long Island, New York, because he considered their Central American nation to be too dangerous a place for the girls to be raised. Heydi (left) arrived to the United States in 2015 and spent only two months at a shelter for migrant minors before she was released to her an aunt Jessica (right) Heydi was granted asylum in June 2016, a year after she entered the United States A saddened Heydi Gámez Garcia kept to herself in a bedroom and was found shortly after midnight July 3 hanging from a closet Heydi was the first to make it across the Mexico-United States border in July 2015. She was granted asylum in June 2016 by the U.S. government, which awarded permanent residency in the United States, and quickly picked up on the English language. That same year Manuel attempted to cross the border but was arrested by the Border Patrol in McAllen, Texas. He was intercepted once again in September 2017 by immigration agents near Santa Teresa, N.M. he tried to enter the country and was convicted of illegally re-entering and was sentenced to 45 days in prison before he was deported to Honduras in November.  Amidst pleas from his daughter to be reconnected again - she was even giving him English lessons through video calls - Manuel promised his distraught daughter he would once again try to evade the strict border measures, especially after she turned 13 in March. The determined parent made it to Mexico in early June and gave his daughter the heads up that he was on his way back to New York. Manuel told his daughter that as soon as he made it to Houston it would just take him about a week before they would be together. 'It has been difficult to be away from her,' Manuel said. 'As a father you always want to be with your children. I was hoping to be with her again.' But just like the previous other times, his path to reuniting with Heydi was once again blocked.  On July 13, Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed through with a request from Romero, who was assisted by Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and gave Manuel permission to travel from the holding facility in Texas to be with his daughter - just a few years too late. Manuel shared of photo collage of his daughter along with a heartbreaking caption on his Facebook account Wednesday morning. 'It will be difficult to accept your departure, my princess, with the hope that in heaven you will be a little angel of God and that you will give me strength when I can't continue without you, my love.' Heydi is slated to be buried next Tuesday before Manuel flies back to turn himself in. Romero hopes immigration officials would grant him a chance to prove his asylum case. 'This is a man who is completely emotionally destroyed, and locking him in a prison would kill him,' Romero said.  'Apart from that, if the government deported him, his life is at risk in Honduras and a tragedy could become another tragedy.'   ","<h2>Heartbreaking picture emerges of Honduran father visiting his daughter, 13, on life support in NYC after she hanged herself because ICE rejected his asylum for FOURTH time - but he's now allowed to switch off her machine</h2>"
78,7261685," Published: 16:58 BST, 18 July 2019 ","When Donald Trump told four Congresswomen to 'go back to where you came from' he triggered a wave of protest on both sides of the Atlantic. The House of Representatives voted 240 to 187 to condemn the President, the first official rebuke in over 100 years. BBC breakfast television presenter Naga Munchetty - who is supposed to remain impartial - broke with convention to describe the remarks as 'embedded with racism' adding she was 'furious that a man in his position feels it's OK to skirt the line of using language like that'. Over 180,000 people responded on social media. Clearly allegations of racism touch a raw nerve, particularly in the UK where immigration is still a contentious issue and the Brexit vote was a knee-jerk reaction from people frightened that EU nationals would take their jobs. US President Donald Trump, pictured yesterday at a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, told four Congresswomen to 'go back to where you came from' The stream of immigrants into Britain - legal and illegal - shows no sign of abating. Latest figures show 283,000 more people arrived than left, with the greatest number coming from outside the EU. Almost every day Customs officials are intercepting boats in the busy English Channel, packed with would-be refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. Trump has not backed down, tweeting there was 'not a racist bone' in his body and ramping up the furore with further insults, claiming the women are 'whack jobs' and 'the reasons why there are directions on a shampoo bottle'. Defenders like Republican senator John Kennedy says Trump's remarks were 'heartfelt' and 'part of a Democrat con game'. Trump's approval rating from party members subsequently rose by five points. Are we more sensitive on the British side of the Atlantic? No British politician would use this language. Trump's casual use of racial nastiness brings back horrible memories of Enoch Powell's anti-immigration 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968. Powell attacked legislation banning racial discrimination in housing and jobs. He called integration a 'ludicrous misconception' and a 'dangerous delusion', and predicted that 'in 15 or 20 years the black man will have the whip hand over the white man'. At the time, the speech divided the nation, with thousands of London dock workers marching in support of Powell's inflammatory rhetoric. Others condemned the politician for inciting racial hatred and causing social unrest. BBC breakfast television presenter Naga Munchetty, pictured with her co-host Dan Walker yesterday, broke with convention to describe the remarks as 'embedded with racism'  Trump has used the race card repeatedly. On entering office he promised to stop Muslims entering America. He's fighting to build a wall to keep Mexicans and people from Southern and Central America out. He speaks, just as Powell did in 1968, to white people worried about losing their jobs, the people who feel forgotten and neglected by government. The poorly educated who say politics is in the hands of big business and smart ass lefties. Powell was called a racist, but can we say the same of Trump? What he actually said of the women (three of whom were born in the USA) was 'why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came?' As usual, facts are thin on the ground - Trump's tweets tend to be rants designed to kick start a fight rather than debate fact-checked real issues. Trump is keen for a fight with the Democrats to distract attention from the growing scandal about his friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who is facing charges of sex with underage girls. Post Enoch Powell, Britain inched towards a multicultural society with London the home to more nationalities than any other city in the world. Telling someone to 'go back' is a meaningless concept. Most Uber drivers in our major cities have come from somewhere else - how long they stay depends on much they can save for a home. Trump's casual use of racial nastiness brings back horrible memories of Enoch Powell's anti-immigration 'Rivers of Blood' speech in Birmingham in 1968 From Eastern Europe, the Indian subcontinent, most are far better educated than me. They have degrees, qualifications, good language skills. Some have already lived in one or two countries before ending up in London. Their concept of 'home' could be anywhere. After Powell's speech, telling anyone who looked different to a white Briton to 'go home' gradually became unacceptable, although in recent years far right groups like the English Defence League have started to gather strength, recruiting white men of a certain age who yearn for a fake past when Britain was all one colour and everyone had a job. In fact, unemployment is lower than ever, which makes allegiance to these groups an act of racism based on colour and religious prejudice, pure and simple. Last weekend, England's cricket team won the World Cup in a match which attracted millions of viewers and galvanised the nation. Put simply, cricket became hot across cultures and generations. The team looked like no other England team before - Ben Stokes, born in New Zealand, living in Cumbria. Jofra Archer, born in Barbados, now living in the UK, Adil Rashid, born in Bradford of Pakistani parents, Eoin Morgan, born in Dublin, Moeen Ali, born in Birmingham of immigrant parents. A team which truly reflected modern Britain. When it comes to sport, where is home? Last weekend, England's cricket team won the World Cup. Put simply, cricket became hot across cultures and generations. The team looked like no other England team before British-born Asians support England at football and usually divide their support between India, Pakistan, Sri Lankha and Bangladesh at cricket but on this occasion they would have supported the victorious side, whose captain said their strength came from diversity. Adil Rashid added 'Allah is on our side as well'. I wonder how Trump would have congratulated the team knowing Muslims were an integral part of it? Is the President a racist or the kind of coarse political orator Theresa May was complaining about in her final speech at Chatham House this week? She says that politics has become nastier and more imbued with rhetoric but, as Home Secretary in 2013, was responsible for the vans with signs saying 'go home or face arrest' that toured inner cities and it was during her time as Home Secretary that the Windrush scandal saw thousands of people from the Caribbean who had been invited to live in Britain denied passports. May might not use the bombastic language of Trump but she has pandered to the anti-immigration lobby in her time. It's noticeable that Theresa May, and the two men campaigning to step into her shoes next week stopped short of using the R word.

'As a person, I have a democratic right and have freedom of speech that if people send me things, I can share them with other people,' she said. Months later, and after condemnation of the posts from Mayor Erin Thompson who labelled the posts 'appalling and unacceptable', Ms Brown has released an apology.

Trump made his presence known throughout the lawmakers' press conference via Twitter But as the congresswomen addressed reporters, the President renewed his attack of 'radical left Democrats' whose open border policies, he claimed, would cripple the the country with crime.  He also accused them of siding with terrorist organisations rather than US ally, Israel, and implied that weren't willing to appreciate the true horror of the 9/11 attacks.  Trump timed his criticism to coincide with the four lawmakers' response to an earlier tweet in which the President had suggested they 'go back from where you came'.    But the four women refused to answer any of the president's specific charges against them.   The President doubled down on his attack of 'radical left Democrats' whose open border policies, he claimed, would cripple the the country with crime  Omar, particularly, has been targeted by Trump has accused of her of being a communist and sympathetic to al Qaeda.  'I will not dignify it with an answer,' said Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. And Ocasio-Cortez said she would not change any past statements - even if her words gave Trump fuel against them.  'I don't think it would have changed anything because first of all, he made statements that were blatantly untrue,' she said. 'So whether he was citing comments or not citing comments if he didn't have what he wanted to say he would make tup. This president operates in complete bad faith.' Trump claimed that moderate Democrats, by sticking by the 'squad', were indirectly endorsing a hatred of the US and its ally, Israel She also argued Trump threw personal attacks at lawmakers because 'he does not know how to defend his policies.  'So what he does is attack us personally. And that is what this is all about. He can't look a child in the face and he can't look all Americans in the face and justify why this country is throwing them in cages.  'So instead, he tells us that I should go back to the great borough of the bronx and make it better and that's what I'm here to do.' And while the president was the main target of 'the squad,' one lawmaker did manage to get in a knock at Speaker Nancy Pelosi's shot at them - that they are just four people. 'We are more than four people,' Pressley said. 'Our squad is big. Our squad includes any person committed to building a more equitable and just world.'  She added: 'And given the size of this squad and this great nation, we cannot, we will not be silenced.' It's was Pelosi's knock down of the four young liberal members that started a feud between her and the progressive wing but that internecine battle ended when Trump threw himself into the arena.  Rep. Ayanna Pressley charged the president with trying to distract for his policies at the border  Reps. Ilham Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib held a press conference Monday to fight back against the president Ocasio-Cortez and Omar hug Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, New York Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Background Known by her initials, AOC was born in The Bronx, New York City, to Puerto Rican parents. Before entering Congress, she worked for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign and as a bartender. Controversies AOC caused a backlash among Israeli campaign groups for branding the IDF's response to the 2018 Gaza border flare-ups a 'massacre' and labeling Israel's presence in the West Bank an 'occupation'. Shortly after entering the House, she slammed Trump as a 'racist' in a TV interview. She said: 'The words he uses…are historic dog whistles of white supremacy.  'The president certainly didn't invent racism, but he's certainly given a voice to it.' Last month, her comments likening migrant holding facilities to 'concentration camps' sparked outrage among senior GOP figures, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy who demanded an apology, which AOC refused to give. Radical policies AOC masterminded the proposed Green New Deal, which seeks to overhaul economic inequality through a raft of public works projects and phase out fossil fuels.  The cost of these measures have been estimated to but an eye-watering $3.9trillion on the US purse.  It has been supported by only a handful of fellow Democrats and come under fire from Republicans. Several high-profile Democrats such as 2020 hopeful Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have suggested that AOC's radical policies would make the party unelectable.  Ilhan Omar, 36, Minnesota  Background Omar was born and raised in Somalia by her father after her mother died when she was two. They fled the country to escape civil war and she arrived in New York when she was 10. She was one of two Muslim women to be the first elected to Congress in 2018.  On entering the House, she fought successfully to change its longstanding ban on head-wear, allowing her to keep her Hijab on. Controversies Earlier this year, she was reported to have said 'some people did something' in regards to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, prompting a backlash from Trump. And in January, she was forced to apologize for using 'anti-Semitic tropes' after she suggested that US support for Israel stemmed from donations from a pro-Israel lobby.  Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader, branded the comments 'hurtful'. Radical policies Omar has called for a significant reduction in military spending and 'perpetual aggression'. She also supports free tuition fees for college students. She has rallied behind Bernie Sanders' proposal to to eliminate all $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt by levying a 0.5 per cent tax on sales.  Omar has also branded the current Federal minimum wage a 'poverty wage' and supports raising it to $15 per hour.  Ayanna Pressley, 45, Massachusetts  Background Born in Ohio but raised in Chicago, Pressley as the only child of a single mother because her father was 'in and out of prison'. She went on to serve as Secretary of State John Kerry's political director. She is the first African-American woman to be elected to the US Congress from Massachusetts.  Controversies In January, she apologized after quoting Alice Walker's book The Color Purple, saying she wasn't aware of the author's recent praise of an anti-Semitic writer.  And recently, she implied that ethnic minorities who work for the US Customs and Border Protection some betraying their own backgrounds. She said that they are a 'cog' in a system which is imprisoning migrants which 'look just like them'.   And in her victory speech after her primary victory, she called President Trump: 'a racist, misogynistic, truly empathy-bankrupt man'. Radical policies Like most of the 'squad' Pressley supports Medicare for all by ramping up taxes as well as free education for university students.  She is a proponent of the 'take a knee' campaign which sees sports stars kneel during the national anthem to highlight police brutality against people of color.  Pioneered by Colin Kapernick, it has come under scrutiny by the President.  Rashida Tlaib, 31, Michigan  Background The oldest of 14 children, she was born in Detroit to working class Palestinian parents. Tlaib entered the Michigan state House before being one of the first Muslim women elected to the US Congress.  Controversies  On the day she entered Congress, Tlaib told a group of supporters her mission was to impeach Trump, who she branded a 'motherf*****'. And in May, Republicans accused Tlaib of spitting anti-Semitic remarks after she said talking about the Holocaust was 'calming'. Trump tweeted: 'Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust.  'She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.' But Democrats insist that she was referring to the efforts of her Palestinian ancestors in creating a safe haven for the Jewish people.  Radical policies She has called for the Immigration Customs Enforcement agency to be abolished and wants a $15 per hour minimum wage. She often rallies against the super-rich and vows to protect the unions to fight against wealthy Wall Street businesses.  She advocates scrapping the cap on what millionaires pay into the Social Security system.  Shortly before the lawmakers began their press conference on Capitol Hill, the president took to Twitter to get in a last series of jabs - accusing them of being  'anti-Israel, pro Al-Qaeda' and wanting a 'communist country.' 'We will never be a Socialist or Communist Country. IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE, YOU CAN LEAVE! It is your choice, and your choice alone. This is about love for America. Certain people HATE our Country....,' he wrote in a series of tweets. '....They are anti-Israel, pro Al-Qaeda, and comment on the 9/11 attack, “some people did something.” Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders, which means drugs, crime, human trafficking, and much more....,' he noted. '....Detention facilities are not Concentration Camps! America has never been stronger than it is now – rebuilt Military, highest Stock Market EVER, lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before. Keep America Great!,' he concluded.   One of Trump's key allies, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, weighed in on the row by branding the President's comments 'reprehensible'.  He told BBC's Today: 'I don't see the President as a racist, but here's the thing, if you continue to say and act in that manner then we have to say, maybe you weren't a racist, but maybe you're turning into one.  'What he said over the weekend, I think was reprehensible and Republican elected leaders that can't call it for what it is, shame on them.'  Scaramucci also accused senior White House advisors of being too 'afraid' to confront the President.  Earlier Monday Trump advised the progressive Democrats who don't like the way he's running the country that they can move somewhere else, as he upped the ante against four Democratic representatives. Trump said the legislators should 'go back where they came from' in a controversial message on Sunday that the women are blasting as racist.  He didn't say who he was talking about, but it was inferred that he tweaking Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the members of her 'squad,' including American-born Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley but also Somali-American legislator Ilhan Omar. He suggested Monday that the women are communists and denied that he was making a racist attack on them. Responding to a question from DailyMail.com, he at first declined to name names on Monday, but hit Omar by name.   'Well I don't mention – I didn't mention names. And I didn't do that,' he said. He proceeded to say they should leave, if they don't like it America, as other reporters chimed in to ask where the women, all of whom but Omar,  who were born in American should go.  'If you're not happy here then you can leave. As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that's what I say all the time,' he said. 'That's what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think it's controversial.' He added, 'A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it. But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time, very simply, you can leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want, don't come back, it's okay too. But if you're not happy you can leave.' Naming Omar, the president referenced the Muslim congresswoman's nationality and claimed she's anti-Semitic. 'When I hear the statements that they've made, and in come case you have somebody that comes from Somalia – which is a failed government, a failed state – who left Somalia, who ultimately came here, and now is a congresswoman who's never happy, says horrible things about Israel. Hates Jews. Hates Jews!' he claimed. He ripped Ocasio-Cortez as he continued to explain himself, saying, 'It's very simple. And if the Democrats want to wrap their bows around this group of four people – one of them kept Amazon out of New York. Tens of thousands of jobs, would have been a great thing, and she kept Amazon from going. 'Would have been a great deal. I mean, could he have made better? Maybe. But tens of thousands of jobs, and New York has not been the same since that happened. It's really hurt New York and New York City. Amazon was going to go, they were going to relocate a major section of their business to New York. She kept them out! That was a terrible thing she did. A terrible thing she did.' Trump continued to unload on the women, bringing up remarks that Republican Senator Lindsey Graham made on 'Fox & Friends' earlier that morning about them.  'Even stronger than what I'm saying. He said they're Communists. I'm saying, I'm saying that they're socialists, definitely. As to whether or not they're Communists, I would think they might be.'  The president did not respond to a question from DailyMail.com in response to the claim about whether he's saying that Ocasio-Cortez is a communist. Tlaib had again vowed on Saturday to 'impeach the M-fer' at a progressive event, infuriating the Republican president. It turned into an all-out brawl from there, with Trump attacking the women on Twitter, and the legislators slapping back. It continued into Monday, with the president tweeting about the women, and then attacking them at a South Lawn event, where he was promoting American-made products.  'When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!,' he wrote on Twitter. 'If Democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S.,' he added.  Trump and several Democratic members of Congress entered a Twitter war this weekend when the president demanded Representative Ilhan Omar and some of her colleagues 'go back where they came from.'  His attack was seen as directed at Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Alyanna Pressley and Rashid Tlaib - four young, progressive lawmakers who took office in January after winning in the 2018 wave election that gave back control of the House of Representatives to Democrats.    Pelosi announced Monday House Democrats are composing a resolution condemning President Trump's tweets against the lawmakers. The speaker indicated there will be a vote soon in the chamber, a move designed to put Republicans on the record about their feelings on the president's tweets after few GOP lawmakers, thus far, have defended him. No timing was indicated but Pelosi announced the forthcoming resolution in a letter to colleagues on Monday.  'The House cannot allow the President's characterization of immigrants to our country to stand.  'Our Republican colleagues must join us in condemning the President's xenophobic tweets.  'Please join us in supporting a forthcoming resolution sponsored by Congressman Tom Malinowski, who was born abroad, and Congressman Jamie Raskin, along with other Democratic Members born abroad,' she noted in her letter. Trump was accused of a racist attack against the lawmakers, of whom only Omar was born overseas. She and her family fled war in Somalia and she is now a U.S. citizen. The rest of the lawmakers were born in the United States.  President Donald Trump says progressive Democrats who don't like the way he's running the country can move somewhere else, as he upped the ante against four Democratic representatives, who are also women of color, that he's been clashing with on Twitter Trump mocked reporters at the end of the event for asking about the controversy - but he came prepared with notes on Rep. Ilhan Omar, who he attacked for saying that 'some people did something' on 9/11 in previous comments Trump's latest volley could be a reaction to Rep. Rashida Tlaib's (left) promise to impeach him and Rep. Ilhan Omar's (right) perceived attacks on Israel   Nancy Pelosi announcedHouse Democrats are composing a resolution condemning President Trump 's tweets He has not backed down and opened his new line of attack on Monday, in what could be a reaction to Tlaib's promise to impeach him and Omar's perceived attacks on Israel.  Omar and Tlaib are the first Muslim women elected to Congress.  Shortly after she took office, a video emerged of Tlaib at a MoveOn.org event in January, vowing of Trump: 'We're going to impeach the motherf***er!'  She reiterated that promise on Saturday when she addressed the liberal Netroots Nation conference. 'We're going to to impeach the m*fer, don't worry. We're going to impeach him,' she said to applause.   Tlaib's fury at Trump came after she and other Democratic lawmakers visited migrant detention facilities on the border and slammed the president for the condition immigrations were being held in.  'As a nation, we need to realize, we're going to look back at this moment as a very, very dark time. We are. Not only because of who is in the White House, but more importantly because of the policies, and we're going to look back and say, what did we do, as a nation to push against this,' the Michigan Democrat warned at Saturday's conference for progressives. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has slammed Trump for the treatment of migrants held in detention centers at the border; above, Tliab (center) testifies on the issue with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left) and Ayanna Pressley (right) after their visit to the border Representatives Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley hae dubbed themselves 'the squad'      'This is a whole generation of children who will never forget what our nation did to them. They will never forget the trauma.'  And Omar set off a fire storm in February with her suggestion that the Israel lobby was using its resources to buy off supporters. 'It's all about the Benjamins,' she tweeted about the influential group. She later apologized for her remarks, which critics said were anti-Semitic, and acknowledged that they were wrong. And, in March, she appeared to minimize the September 11 attacks when she noted a Muslim group was formed in its wake 'because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.' Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Born: New York City Parents from: Puerto Rico and America   Ilhan Omar Born: Mogadishu, Somalia Parents from: Somalia Heritage:  Somalian and Yemeni Rashida Tlaib Born: Detroit, Michigan Parents from: West Bank and East Jerusalem Heritage: Palestinian Ayanna Pressley   Born: Cincinnati, Ohio Parents from: America Heritage:  African American An experienced Democratic operative told DailyMail.com that the president was angering Speaker Nancy Pelosi and ramping up his base at the same time. 'Trump has figured out how to piss off Nancy and get his base agitated at the same time. It's like a sinister chess game where he's trying to move both side's pieces,' the operative said. The president hasn't let up.   In a Twitter rant Sunday night, Trump doubled down on his attacks and claimed the Democratic lawmakers hate Israel, an accusation that will likely incite fury among the GOP base. 'So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion,' he wrote.   But Trump's attacks united Pelosi and the members of 'the squad' in their outrage against the president. It was a show of unity after the speaker and the four got into a feud of their own.    Earlier this month 'the squad' all voted against the $4.6 billion Republican border bill that would provide aide to the border, including migrant detention centers. Pelosi backed the bill and helped get it through the House after several reports emerged of the horrific conditions migrants faced at certain centers along the border that hold those who crossed the border illegally. Ocasio-Cortez ranted against the bill on Twitter even as it ultimately passed. The speaker fired back.   'All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,' Pelosi told The New York Times. 'But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got.'  She also lectured Democrats in a closed-door meeting in the Capitol about fighting their battles on social media.  ‘You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it. But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just ok,’ Pelosi said during the meeting, according to a source in the room.  But after Trump's remarks on Sunday, Pelosi jumped at the opportunity to defend the four congresswomen         Then Ocasio-Cortez, in an explosive interview with The Washington Post, accused the speaker of “the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.'  Several black lawmakers defended Pelosi and slammed the liberal New York lawmaker for whining about not getting her way but the internecine battle within the party became forgotten when the president stepped in.  'Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,' Trump wrote on Twitter of ''Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen' on Sunday. 'Then come back and show us how it is done.'  'These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!,' he added. But the speaker promptly defended her members of Congress.  'When [Trump] tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again,” Pelosi tweeted. “Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.' And the lawmakers fought back themselves.  Ocasio-Cortez led the defense of her squad.  Reps. Ilham Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women elected to Congress 'Mr. President, the country I “come from,” & the country we all swear to, is the United States. But given how you’ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you & the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet,' she tweeted.  'You are angry because you don’t believe in an America where I represent New York 14, where the good people of Minnesota elected @IlhanMN, where @RashidaTlaib fights for Michigan families, where @AyannaPressley champions little girls in Boston,' she added.  The squad members also had words for the president. 'Yo @realDonaldTrump, I am fighting corruption in OUR country. I do it every day when I hold your admin accountable as a U.S. Congresswoman. Detroit taught me how to fight for the communities you continue to degrade & attack. Keep talking, you’ll be out of the WH soon,' Tlaib tweeted in response.   Pressley wrote: 'THIS is what racism looks like. WE are what democracy looks like. And we’re not going anywhere. Except back to DC to fight for the families you marginalize and vilify everyday.' And Omar tweeted: 'Mr. President, As Members of Congress, the only country we swear an oath to is the United States. Which is why we are fighting to protect it from the worst, most corrupt and inept president we have ever seen.' Omar and her family came to the United States in the early 1990s to escape the war in Somalia. She became a citizen in 2000 when she was 17 years old. Tlaib is the daughter of two Palestinian immigrants and Ocasio-Cortez's mother is from Puerto Rico. Tlaib was born in Detroit while Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx borough of New York City. Pressley is the first African American woman elected to Congress to represent Massachusetts. She was born in Cincinnati.      ","<h2>'It is time for us to impeach this president': Omar, AOC and radical 'squad' hit back after Trump tells them to leave America if they don't like it - but he fires off yet another tweet during their address</h2>"
83,7249027," Published: 15:46 BST, 15 July 2019 ","England became World Champions at cricket for the first time yesterday, with the most diverse team in its history. The side included players born in South Africa, New Zealand and Barbados, and two Muslim men of Pakistani heritage. Yet the one thing that unites them, apart from a rare talent at a game Americans fortunately find too baffling to take up, is that they’re all English. And for anyone to suggest otherwise would be racist, right? It would mean a bigoted refusal to accept that someone born outside of a country, or whose family was born outside of a country, could ever be considered to have the nationality of that country. The victorious England cricket team - pictures yesterday with their hard-won World Cup - is a very diverse group of men who all proudly represent THEIR country, England But as England joyously celebrated the wonderfully multi-cultural group of men who had instilled such pride in THEIR country, President Donald Trump hit a very different tone towards a group of his fellow Americans. He posted three extraordinarily offensive tweets about four Democrat Congresswomen known in Washington as ‘The Squad’. They are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachussets. Their common denominator, other than being young, female, vocal (especially against Trump) and politically left leaning, is that none of them is white. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx to parents of Puerto Rican descent. Pressley, who is black, was born in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago. Tlaib was born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrants. Omar is a refugee from Somalia. So three of them were born in the U.S. and one was born outside. But all four of them are legal U.S. citizens. In other words, they’re all Americans. In fact, they’re as American, and as entitled to live in America, as Donald Trump.  Lest we forget, Trump’s own grandfather Friedrich Trump was born in Germany and emigrated to the U.S. as a teenager.  The women Trump was targeting are ALL Americans: Ocasio-Cortez (top left) was born in the Bronx to parents of Puerto Rican descent. Pressley (bottom right), who is black, was born in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago. Tlaib (bottom left) was born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrants. Omar (top right) is a refugee from Somalia. That’s how the Trumps came to be in America, and that’s how Donald was able to become President of the United States. Now, if you ask him, I’m sure Donald will tell you he’s the most American of any Americans you’ve ever met, despite his grandfather coming from German and his mother being Scottish. Yet if you ask him about The Squad, you’ll get a very different answer.  In his tweets yesterday, Trump said the following: ‘So interesting to see “Progressive Democrat Congresswomen” who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all) now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need you help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!’ Trump’s anger at these women was driven by their undeniable visceral hatred of everything he says and does. They’re all super-woke liberals who live, breathe and spew a ferociously politically correct agenda that I too find extremely irritating.   Trump's controversial tweet sparked outrage across the political spectrum for using racially inflammatory language AOC, unofficial leader of The Squad, regularly spouts outrageous virtue-signalling socialist claptrap and viciously partisan anti-Trump abuse that makes my skin crawl. But here’s the thing: she, like the other three Congresswomen, enjoys an absolute right to do so under the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because she’s an American citizen. That’s the real power of a great democracy: freedom to say what you want, when you want, about what you want. So when President Trump tells them all to ‘go back’ to ‘places from which they came’, he’s inferring that somehow they’re not real Americans, or certainly not as American as he is. And that, whichever way you try to spin it, is a racist sentiment. From my 13 years of knowing him, I don’t believe Donald Trump is a racist. But I do think he is far too casual with his language, and says stuff that has unsavory racist overtones – like his ‘Mexico.. is bringing their rapists’ jibe back in 2015 and his ‘good people on both sides’ nonsense when white supremacists marched in Charlottesville. In both examples, as with this latest one, I can see the point Trump was clumsily trying to make. But he didn’t properly consider how to make those points without veering into careless, insensitive, racist-sounding phraseology that will inevitably fuel and empower genuine racists. And that’s just unacceptable. Understandably, outrage erupted over his comments from many senior Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi raged that this proved Trump’s slogan ‘Making America Great Again’ “has always been about making America white again.” Senator Cory Booker, a black presidential candidate for 2020, said simply: ‘We’ve heard this our whole lives. Now we hear it from the Oval Office.’ Another candidate, Joaquin Castro, tweeted: ‘They’re Americans. You’re a bigot.’ Trump predictably doubled down, tweeting last night: ‘So sad to see Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion…their disgusting language and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged.’ Yet the truth is his own language was disgusting.  Trump has not backed away from his original tweets, and even took to the social media platform again later on Sunday to double down on them  And from a political standpoint, it was also totally self-defeating. The Squad gleefully seized on his ‘go back’ remarks to go on the attack. ‘You are stoking white nationalism,’ accused Omar. ‘You are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda.’ Pressley posted a screenshot of Trump’s tweets and said: ‘THIS is what racism looks like.’ Tlaib said: ‘Keep talking, you just make me work harder. I’m proud of my Palestinian roots and a WEAK bully like you never wins.’ Ocasio-Cortez retorted: ‘Mr President, the country I “come from” and the country we all swear to, is the United States.’ The supreme irony of all this is that until Trump’s tweets, the Democrats were eating themselves alive and accusing each other of racism. Last week, Ocasio-Cortez sensationally charged Pelosi with ‘explicity singling out newly elected women of color’ after the Speaker criticised The Squad for their far-left proposals on issues like health care and the environment. Trump questioning the nationality of these woman demeans him as President and he owes them an apology Pelosi even suffered the grotesque indignity of Trump mischievously defending her and saying she was not a racist. Now, just when there seemed to be a potentially election-ruinous chasm developing between the old and new guard of the Democrats, with alleged racism at the heart of it, Trump’s managed to reunite them against their preferred common enemy: him. So this was very bad politics. But worse than that, it was very bad rhetoric. In fact, let’s call it exactly what it was: very bad racist rhetoric. Trump’s ‘go back’ attack on The Squad may play well with his base, which probably views AOC and her colleagues with the exact same disdain as he does. But it demeans him as President to utter it, and it demeans the office of the Presidency too. You owe these four American women an apology, Mr President.  ","<h2>PIERS MORGAN: AOC and her super-woke socialist Squad may be very irritating, Mr President, but they're also as American as you and to suggest otherwise is racist</h2>"
84,7248885," Published: 15:41 BST, 15 July 2019 ","Tom Homan, the former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Monday he wanted to give Democratic Congressman Jesus Garcia a 'beating' during a House hearing last week on Trump immigration policies at the border. Homan and Garcia got into a heated exchange during the former ICE director's testimony when the Latino representative suggested Homan did not care about migrant children dying at the border. After Homan retired from government service he became a Fox New contributor, and he told the Fox & Friends panel he had to hold himself back from taking a swing at Garcia last week. 'If you notice, I hesitated a minute before I started yelling because I actually think about getting up and throwing that man a beating right there in the middle of the room because when you tell somebody that spent their career saving lives that I don't care about dying children and I'm a racist. That's where I broke and I had enough,' Homan fired back a few days after the interaction. Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Tom Homan said he wanted to give Democratic Rep. Jesus Garcia 'a beating' during a House hearing last week Homan clashed with the congressman on Friday in a heated exchange during his testimony on enforcing Trump administration immigration policies at the southern border Garcia accused Homan of being racist and suggesting he did not care if migrant children died. 'How can you possibly allow this to happen under your watch?' Garcia asked. 'Is it because these children don't look like children that are around you?' When asked if he had calmed down from the confrontation with Garcia yet, Homan said 'I did until you just showed that clip of someone calling me a racist and say I didn't care about dying children.' During the clash on Friday, Garcia questioned how Homan could allow Trump's zero tolerance immigration policies flourish while he was ICE director – particularly the policies that led to the separation of children from the families they crossed with illegally. 'How can you possibly allow this to happen under your watch?' Garcia asked. 'Is it because these children don't look like children that are around you?' Homan dismissed the accusations and claimed it was up to Congress to change the laws that would make the situation at the border better for migrants and those seeking asylum. 'Your comments are disgusting,' Homan clapped back at the congressman.

Homan had several other moments during the hearing where he clashed with Democratic members of Congress. At one point, Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly accused Homan of allowing migrants to be treated like 'subhumans' by ICE agents and said they handled these people with 'hardly human care.' 'Is there no limit to what you will justify in this administration when it comes to the mistreatment of our fellow human beings, and do you have no shame about the fact, as our colleague said this morning, it's all done in the shadow of the American flag?' Connolly asked. Homan interrupted to say he did not appreciate the characterization and was 'extremely frustrated' by the language used. Connolly said he didn't care. 'You're not at the border right now!' he said. 'You're in a hearing room.

The video was released on Saturday just hours before raids began in at least 10 cities across the US. 'A message for all Angelenos: Here in Los Angeles, we will not be coordinating with ICE. Your city is on your side, we are in this together,' the mayor tweeted in the caption of the video.  Garcetti is seen in the video standing next to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore as he tells viewers: 'We've all heard reports the Trump administration is threatening to round up and deport thousands of immigrant families in cities across America this weekend.' Scroll down for video   Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (right, with Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore) took a stand against the ICE raids in a new video released on Twitter that sees the official reassuring residents that 'we are in this together' 'I want every Angeleno to know their rights and how to exercise them. Remember, you have the right to remain silent. You don't have to open your door to an ICE agent that doesn't have a warrant signed by a judge. 'You have the right to speak to a lawyer before signing any documents or speaking to law enforcement. And, if you need help finding an attorney, you can call 311 and learn more about our Justice Fund and other resources that offer legal support,' the mayor said. Garcetti encouraged residents to 'keep a record of everything that happens'.  'Take note of an officer's name and badge number, of when and where you are being questioned, so you can use that information in your own defense,' he said. The mayor also said in the video: 'I want you to know, you do not need to be afraid. Your city is on your side, and rest assured, here in Los Angeles we are not coordinating with ICE.'  Chief Moore than told viewers that the department 'is not assisting ICE in any way'. 'We will not enforce immigration laws that are civil in nature and fall under the justification of the federal government. Immigration is a federal matter. Safety is a police matter, and we're not going to mix those two,' Moore added.  Authorities launched small-scale operations seeking to arrest undocumented immigrants over the weekend in an apparent start to Trump's vow to launch mass deportation round-ups across the US.  The operation, which Trump revealed on Twitter last month and postponed before telling reporters on Friday that it would proceed, was expected to target hundreds of recently arrived families in about 10 cities who had been ordered deported by an immigration judge. The removal operations are meant to deter a surge in Central American families fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries, with many seeking asylum in the US.

In the year to May, a record 848,570 people moved to Australia permanently - a surge of 5.7 per cent. When the number of departures was factored in, the annual net immigration rate stood at 294,430, a level that is now four times where it was two decades ago.  Foreign workers are continuing to earn more than locals as Australia's immigration pace soars to a new record high (pictured is a stock image of a fruit picker) Australia's immigration surge has coincided with five years of flat wages. However the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, a think tank, said it was a myth that employers had used the temporary skilled migration program to undercut local wages.  In the 2017-18 financial year, temporary skilled migrants earned an average base salary of $95,000, which was 13.8 per cent times higher than Australia's average full-time salary of $83,500.  The CEDA research also found 42 per cent of temporary skilled migrants earned more than $78,000 a year, compared with 35 per cent of permanent skilled migrants. 'Temporary skilled visa holders experience better labour market outcomes than other migrants,' it said in its report, 'Effects of temporary migration'. Their numbers include international students and holidaymakers on working visas.  Between 2006 and 2015, more than two million immigrants came to Australia, or more than double the number who came between 1996 and 2005 (pictured is a Sydney train station) The CEDA report disputed the link between high immigration and flat wages but it did hint at congestion problems in Sydney and Melbourne, which receive the vast bulk of new arrivals. It noted that 70 per cent of temporary migrants lived in Australia's two biggest states. Broken down, 45 per cent of these short-term arrivals with working visas live in New South Wales with another 25 per cent in Victoria. Both states also have Australia's lowest jobless rate of 4.6 per cent, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. While the CEDA report was in favour of high population growth, it did point out that 29 per cent of Australia's immigrants during the past 70 years had in fact arrived during the past decade. Between 2006 and 2015, more than two million immigrants came to Australia, or more than double the number who came between 1996 and 2005. From post-war 1946 to 2015, seven million people moved to Australia.  While the CEDA report was in favour of high population growth, it did point out that 29 per cent of Australia's immigrants during the past 70 years had in fact arrived during the past decade",<h2>Revealed: How much foreign workers REALLY earn as Australia's immigration pace soars to a new record</h2>

'If you don't commit, we're leaving,' the woman told her, as two security guards approached her. 'You are not committing,' she told Warren, before she did just that. Warren told the crowd as the protesters excited the ballroom she was addressing that she wants to expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship not just for Dreamers but families, too.   'A path for citizenship that is fair and attainable,' she said of her plan.  She said illegal immigrants who have been in American for years and and 'integrated' into their communities should be be allowed to remain in the country.   'Part three is I will stop this ugly mess at our borders,' she said.

Warren said that companies should have to choose whether they want to provide the platform for product sales or create products, 'But you don't get to do both.' Additionally, she said the U.S. needs to enforce existing anti-trust laws so that large companies do not have as much power to steamroll small businesses. 'Over time, creating these bigger and bigger giants, are both enormously damaging to the marketplace, to consumers and ultimately to democracy,' she said. 'When giant companies have so much power that they get to call the shots in Washington, it's no longer just about the economy that they own, it's our entire country. We've got to fight back on this.'  Warren said the criminal justice system needs to be reformed, front to back, so that minorities receive equal justice under the law. She said she strongly supports marijuana legalization. 'It's not just for the few of you who think it's funny,' she said after some attendees whooped and hollered. 'Not just for the mellow folks in the back. Or the folks with all the cookies over there.' Rather, she said blacks and whites use marijuana at the same rate, yet blacks are three times more likely to go to jail for abusing the substance. 'So easy answer for me. Make it legal, and then that problem goes away,' she added.  Cash bail also needs to be eliminated and cannot be replaced with a system that discriminates against certain communities. For-profit prisons should also be banned, she said. 'We've got to reform this whole system,' she asserted.    ",<h2>'We need legalization!'

POTUS said that agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), would conduct a series of raids on Sunday to deport immigrants with outstanding orders to leave the country.  Trump said the raids would primarily target those with a criminal record, but immigration advocates say the agency is increasingly targeting families who have recently entered the country.   Reports of ICE officials serving deportation orders on illegal immigrants circulated on social media as Donald Trump confirmed raids would begin on Sunday. A file image shows ICE officials during a targeted enforcement operation in February 2017 New York Mayor Bill De Blasio tweeted that he received reports of attempted but reportedly unsuccessful ICE enforcement actions in Sunset Park and Harlem on Saturday New York Mayor Bill De Blasio tweeted that he received reports of attempted but reportedly unsuccessful ICE enforcement actions in Sunset Park and Harlem on Saturday. He wrote: '@NYCImmigrants and advocates are connecting with residents and distributing resources door to door.  'Remember: you have rights. Call 311 and say ActionNYC for help.'   Trump and other officials have previously claimed that 'millions' would be deported, but it is thought that such an operation would be logistically difficult. ICE has obtained court orders for the removal of about one million undocumented migrants, according to a senior administration official, but the initial raids will target some 2,000 across at least 10 cities, the New York Times reported this week. 'They came in illegally,' Trump told reporters at the White House. 'They are going to take people out and they are going to send them back to their country.' Trump said ICE would focus mainly on people with convictions, including gang members, but also others. 'It starts on Sunday and they're going to take people out and they're going to bring them back to their countries,' Trump added. Donald Trump, (left),  said the raids would primarily target those with a criminal record, but New York Mayor Bill De Blasio was keen to point out immigrant rights and directed them to agencies where they could seek assistance  'Or they're going to take criminals out, put them in prison, or put them in prison in the countries they came from.' While the focus will be on removing criminals, Trump said the raids would also target 'people that came into our country, not through a process, that just walked over a line. They have to leave.'  According to the Pew Research Center, there are about 10.5 million undocumented migrants in the United States, and two-thirds have been in the country more than 10 years. Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said Wednesday that ICE has removal orders for some one million migrants, but added that it has nowhere near the manpower or facilities to arrest and deport that many. The operation is set to target undocumented families in an expedited docket in the immigration court system.  According to ICE, these immigrants were given deportation orders by a judge for failing to appear in court, also received notification from the agency, CBS reported.  Nancy Pelosi, (pictured), called the ICE plan 'heartless raids on families' and said Sundays are when many Hispanic immigrant families are in church Pelosi read from a card with information about how to handle ICE raids earlier this week  Last month Trump gave Democrats a two week deadline to change the nation's laws that guarantee the right for people to apply for asylum as raids which had been planned were called off.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will launch sweeping deportation operations on Sunday as the administration expands its crackdown on undocumented immigrants, the New York Times reported. Democrats lashed out at the plans, saying they threaten people who have lived in the United States for many years and built families that include US citizens. Pelosi called the ICE plan 'heartless raids on families' and said Sundays are when many Hispanic immigrant families are in church. She said families feel very 'threatened and scared' by the raids. In a file photo from 2017, thousands of people take part in the 'Free the People Immigration March' to protest actions taken by President Donald Trump and his administration 'These families are hardworking members of our communities and our country. This brutal action will terrorize children and tear families apart,' she told reporters. 'Many of these families are mixed-status families,' she added, referring to families who include members in the United States legally and illegally, such as migrants with children born inside the country.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighted in on Twitter earlier this week, urging people to share Spanish-language guidelines such as 'toma fotos y videos' – meaning take photos and videos.  'Por favor comparte,' Clinton wrote, or please share. They were taking a cue from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also urged people to 'know your rights.' 'Check your neighbors & know your rights,' she tweeted earlier Thursday.  'Remember: no one can enter your home without a *judicial warrant.*' she advised. She also wrote that 'Sometimes ICE will try to show other papers to get in your house. Judicial warrants are from a court.'    ICE hasn't commented on the raids, which would come with Trump seeking to demonstrate toughness on immigration amid a still-strong influx of migrants across the border with Mexico. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said 104,344 migrants were detained after crossing the border in June, down 28 percent from May's 13-year record high but still an extremely high figure, some 60,000 more than the same month last year.",<h2>ICE raids start a day early: NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio claims agents tried to round up migrants in New York as Trump confirms a crackdown on illegal immigrants who have been served deportation orders</h2>
91,7244281," Published: 19:36 BST, 13 July 2019 ","The former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement has blasted a Democrat Congressman who accused him of racism, imploring lawmakers to stop grandstanding and change the laws to fix a broken immigration system. Tom Homan, who stepped down as acting director of ICE last month, delivered the fiery rebuke in testimony before a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Friday.  At the hearing, Rep. Jesus Garcia, an Illinois Democrat, asked Homan if he didn't care about migrant children 'because the children don't look like children that are around you.'  'Have you ever held a deceased child in your arms?' Garcia asked Homan. 'First of all, your comments are disgusting,' Homan replied. 'And yes I held a five-year-old boy in my arms in the back of that tractor-trailer, and I knelt down beside him said a prayer for him knowing what his last 30 minutes was like. And I had a five-year-old son at the time.'  Homan delivered a fiery defense of border agents during the hearing, defending border agents and ripping a Congressman who accused him of racism Rep. Jesus Garcia delivered a tirade asking Homan if he didn't care about migrant children 'because the children don't look like children that are around you' 'For you to sit there and insult my integrity and my love for my country and for children - that's why this whole thing needs to be fixed. And you're the member of Congress. Fix it,' Homan added.  'I will not sit here and have anybody say that I don't care about children because they're not the same color as my children,' Homan blasted after Chairman Elijah Cummings banged the gavel to restore order. The hearing was convened to examine allegations of poor and miserable conditions in processing stations for people who cross the border illegally, and a new report on child separations at the border last year. Homan delivered a fiery defense of border agents during the hearing, arguing that they were enforcing the law as written and charging Congress with fixing broken laws. 'If you don't like this, do your job. Fix it,' Homan said. 'Those men and women who chose a life of service to this nation deserve better, not only from the media but those in this committee and other members of Congress.'  'As a 34-year veteran of law enforcement, it is shocking, shocking to see constant attacks against those that leave the safety and security of their homes every day, put on a Kevlar vest and put a gun on their hip and risk their own safety to defend this nation,' he said, growing visibly emotional at times. Homan is sworn in for testimony on Friday. He delivered a detailed breakdown of the laws he says need to be changed to fix the crisis at the border Homan choked up at times as he defended border agents and implored Congress to change laws that he says create a magnet causing soaring illegal border crossings The hearing came as the number of families, children and other migrants crossing the southern border illegally has surged above 100,000 monthly since March, overwhelming federal agencies' ability to detain them in sanitary conditions.  Earlier in the hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, had reiterated her claim that woman held in a Customs and Border Patrol station had been forced to drink from a toilet.  'Children were being separated from their parents in front of an American flag. And women being called these names under an American flag,' said Ocasio-Cortez, emotion rising in her voice. 'We cannot allow for this.'  Homan blasted back in his testimony: 'Those that attack the professional integrity of those that serve and blatantly throw unsubstantiated allegations against these men and women with zero evidence of guilt are wrong and should be ashamed.'  Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez delivered tear-stained testimony doubling down on her claim that migrant women are forced to drink from 'toilet bowls' at processing centers In his prepared testimony, Homan called on Congress to address loopholes in asylum laws, the Flores Settlement Agreement and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA). He said the burden of proof for asylum claims is 'ridiculously low' for initial interviews. He added that 90 percent pass their first interview but that of those, 90 percent go on to have their asylum claim rejected by a court.  The Flores Settlement Agreement only allows ICE to detain family groups in a family detention center for 20 days, forcing their release before asylum claims can be processed by courts. Homan argued that this combination is a powerful draw for people to cross the border illegally, knowing they will be quickly released before the court rules on their asylum claim, as long as they bring children. Since September, 390,308 family units have been apprehended crossing the southern border illegally, a 469 percent jump from the same period the year prior.  This chart shows apprehensions on the southern border this year (red) versus prior years Homan also called for the TVPRA to be changed to ensure that all unaccompanied minor children who are not victims of trafficking or persecution are returned home and reunited with their families. He argued that failing to return unaccompanied migrant children from Central America, as is routine for those from Mexico, is another powerful incentive for parents to send children on the dangerous journey. Since September, 63,624 unaccompanied children have been apprehended crossing the border illegally, a 70 percent jump from the year prior.   'The constant talk about open borders, a pathway to citizenship for those already here illegally, free health care, zero detention, sanctuary cities and abolish ICE are all acting to entice those most vulnerable to put themselves in the hands of criminal cartels and risk the journey,' Homan said. 'If you truly care about these vulnerable people as you claim, then fix it. You know what needs to be done.' ",<h2>'You're the member of Congress. Fix it!'

92,7242489," Published: 22:23 BST, 12 July 2019 ","The emotive case of a ‘lesbian’ asylum seeker, deported from the United Kingdom and now said to be in hiding in her native Uganda, exposes many of the problems with our complicated immigration policy. At the heart of it is the simple question: how do you know if someone is telling the truth? For this 25-year-old woman insists she is gay and would, therefore, face persecution in her home country where, according to Amnesty International, anyone found to have had a same-sex relationship risks life in prison. Yet when British immigration officials raided her home in London, she was found in bed with a man. That was the key piece of evidence the Home Office used to deport her nearly six years ago. Now, from her East African hiding place, she begs to return to Britain, saying her life is in danger. Her case became public knowledge this week when it emerged that thousands of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money could be spent bringing her back to Britain to appeal her case through our courts. The woman, named only as ‘PN’ after a High Court ruling on keeping her anonymity, could obtain damages from the Government after a judge ruled she had not had a fair hearing (stock image, posed by a model) The woman, named only as ‘PN’ after a High Court ruling on keeping her anonymity, could also obtain damages from the Government after a judge ruled she had not had a fair hearing and was ‘falsely imprisoned’ in a detention centre before being forcibly flown back to the Ugandan city of Entebbe. It is a complex case that will take a long time to resolve. But it rests on whether she is telling the truth — or fabricating facts to increase her chances of successfully claiming asylum here. Is it possible that she was encouraged to say she is a lesbian by those advising her on how to win asylum? Certainly, her testimony is powerfully persuasive. The Mail has heard her story after listening to an audio recording uploaded to the website of a pressure group that is supporting her. The Mail has chosen not to name this pressure group for legal reasons. On this 45-minute recording, PN says: ‘I came to the UK to fight for my life because in my country I was going to be killed. ‘I have been put back in a danger zone by the Home Office. I don’t know when they [the Ugandan authorities] will catch me. My life now is miserable. The Home Office is treating me like a criminal.’ Britain, like many Western nations, offers a refuge to gay men and women who face persecution, violence and even death in their home countries. And PN is one of scores of Ugandans, many female, who have fled here claiming their sexuality puts them at risk at home. Between 2015 and 2017, according to Government statistics, 69 per cent of 567 asylum requests by Ugandans concerned fear of persecution because of their sexual orientation. Of these, it is thought 60 per cent were successful — an impressively high rate. As well as a law that punishes homosexual sex acts with jail and with same-sex marriage being illegal, there is widespread social opposition to — and even hatred of — homosexuality in Uganda. Britain, like many Western nations, offers a refuge to gay men and women who face persecution, violence and even death in their home countries (pictured: A 'Bring Back PN' demonstration at the Home Office in London) Simon Lokodo, the country’s minister for ethics and integrity, said last year: ‘Homosexuality is not allowed and completely unacceptable in Uganda. We can’t and don’t allow it.’ But an examination by the Mail of cases heard in UK immigration tribunals involving female Ugandan asylum seekers who said they were lesbians shows that some claims have failed because, according to judges, women have ‘concocted’ or fabricated evidence. In short, they have lied about being gay. Many named a female partner in the UK to strengthen their case. But these women turned out to be a platonic friend, or didn’t exist. Other ‘lesbian’ asylum seekers have been found living happily with husbands or male partners, and even having biological children with them. One remarkable tale told to the courts involved a middle-aged Ugandan woman who arrived in the UK in 2002 on a false passport provided by a trafficking agent. She lived here illegally and did not claim asylum for 13 years, saying that she did not know the asylum process existed. Astonishingly, when she finally did claim asylum in early 2016, her main argument was that she was a lesbian who had had a relationship with a woman in Uganda years before while keeping her sexuality hidden from her husband of 22 years and their seven children. On the day after her 20th birthday, at 6am, PN's home was raided by immigration officers who found her in bed with a man (pictured: A sign at the 'Bring Back PN' demonstration) This particular woman failed to produce evidence of a female lover in the UK or anywhere else. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the judge remarked that her story was ‘implausible, even impossible’ and threw out her appeal. In another case, a Ugandan woman tried to avoid deportation by claiming she was a lesbian, but could not remember the surname, age, employer or any other details of a woman called Janet with whom she claimed to have had a six‑year relationship in Uganda. Nor could she describe a London lesbian bar called Candy in which she said she had met female partners once a month. The Mail has learned that a number of Ugandan women claim asylum as lesbians many months, or even years, after arriving in the UK, and often after immigration authorities have begun to investigate them. This leads to the key question: is PN’s story all it seems? She was born on July 20, 1993, and, with the help of a trafficking agent, came to the UK aged 17 as an accompanying child on a visitor’s visa. After the visa ran out, she stayed here illegally, living in a flat in Leyton, East London, working as a hairdresser and being paid cash. On the day after her 20th birthday, at 6am, her home was raided by immigration officers who found her in bed with a man. She was taken to the Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire. Two days later, she claimed asylum. A week after that, during an interview with officials, she announced that she was a lesbian who feared her uncle would kill her if she returned to Uganda. Asked about the man she was found in bed with, PN said she’d met him at a party for her birthday the day before, had got drunk, returned to her flat and he had stayed the night. Asked about the man she was found in bed with, PN said she’d met him at a party for her birthday the day before, had got drunk, returned to her flat and he had stayed the night (pictured: The 'Bring Back PN' demonstration) She insisted they had not had sex on that occasion, although she also admitted that she was seeing him because she ‘wanted a child’. In later interviews, PN explained that she realised she was a lesbian at about 13 after being raped five years earlier by her stepfather. PN then alleged that she’d had a number of affairs with women. Her first relationship, she said, was with a woman called Grace, aged about 20, when she was 14. It lasted for three months. The same year, she said, she had an affair with a woman called Justine who was 22. This relationship was discovered by two youths who secretly watched the two women making love. Local vigilantes then threatened violence against her family, she said. Her last gay relationship in Uganda was, she claimed, with a 21-year-old woman called Rose, who arranged her escape by buying her a false passport to come to the UK. Once in Britain, PN says that she had a relationship with a woman called Ruth, although she produced no evidence. She also claimed she was in a relationship with a married woman called Mildred. That said, despite being held in detention at Yarl’s Wood for several months, the mysterious Mildred did not visit her and PN could produce no proof that she existed. Only Rose could be found. She was living in Uganda and very belatedly produced an affidavit confirming her affair with PN. Despite this, the Home Office ruled: ‘The only reliable evidence was that PN was found in bed with a man and . . . the only reasonable conclusion is that she is in a heterosexual relationship with this man and is not a lesbian.’ As a result, PN was taken to an airport in December 2013 to be flown back to Uganda. But the pressure group intervened, confronting the UK immigration team at the airport and PN was subsequently returned to Yarl’s Wood. ‘The guards cancelled my ticket to go on Ethiopian Airways,’ PN explains on the recording heard by the Mail. On a second attempt to send her home, also with Ethiopian Airlines, she was escorted onto the plane. But the Mail understands that after a passenger outcry in sympathy for PN, the pilot refused to fly her back to Uganda. It was only on the third occasion that PN was finally removed from Britain — on Kenya Airways. She explained: ‘When we reached the airport, I was in a van and they lifted me to the plane. ‘There were three seats and I was in the middle. There were two female guards each side. They put me in handcuffs and pinned my arms down. Two male guards stood in front of me to hide me and stop the passengers seeing what was happening to me.’ ‘I tried to shout so that the passengers would come near. ‘One woman came up to me and used my name. She asked if I was PN. ‘We were there for hours. The guards were arguing with passengers. They would not sit down. They wanted me to get out and not go.’ Eventually, the plane departed for Nairobi, Kenya. Even then, PN says ‘passengers were still standing up and guards were pushing them back. A doctor with the guards tried to give me medicine [to calm her down], but I refused.’ Having arrived in Nairobi for a connecting flight to Entebbe in Uganda, PN was put in a wheelchair by the British immigration guards. On arrival in Entebbe, a Ugandan immigration officer took pity on her. He managed to contact the trafficking agent who had brought her to Britain and got them to take her to a safe house. By any standards, it was a stressful experience and one that has not ended. On the recording, made in the year following her deportation, PN says: ‘I am in hiding and I don’t know what to do next.’ Meanwhile, there has been criticism of the role of the hard-Left pressure group in which this young Ugandan has placed her faith. Several prominent British human rights organisations have accused it of manipulating migrants and using them to artificially swell its ranks. The group campaigns for the abolition of immigration controls, an amnesty for all asylum seekers and the closure of every detention centre in the UK. Its protests at airports have successfully halted scores of would-be deportation flights, including of asylum seekers who are convicted criminals. Last Wednesday, its leaders protested outside the Home Office in London. They waved banners and shouted through megaphones: ‘Bring back PN!’ The group says that PN is a victim of serious injustice at the hands of the immigration system and should be returned to Britain immediately. During Wednesday’s protest, one woman told colleagues not to speak to the Mail while a man verbally threatened myself and the photographer, telling us to go away and not to ask any more questions about PN. For its part, the Home Office refuses to comment on when, or if, PN might be returned to Britain. A spokesman says legal proceedings are ongoing. Meanwhile, more than 6,000 miles away in Uganda, a young woman’s life is on hold in what are deeply controversial circumstances — and in a case that may cost British taxpayers a great deal more money.",<h2>The Ugandan woman who says she is a lesbian and claimed asylum in the UK - but was deported after officials found her in bed with a man.

Vanessa O'Rourke, 31, from the United States, will be allowed to remain in Australia despite failing our good character test after an Administrative Appeals Tribunal last week cleared the path for her to be granted a bridging visa that allows her to be released from immigration detention.  O'Rourke is the latest in a growing list of cancer fraudsters hitting the headlines, including Belle Gibson, Alysha Goring and Hanna Dickenson. Gibson ripped off thousands through her bogus claims of curing cancer through healthy eating while Goring and Dickenson ripped off friends and family to indulge in fancy holidays and buy expensive goods. O'Rourke used an extremely dodgy resume to score a job with Medscribe - a private company that operates in south east Queensland and employs trained persons to work alongside qualified medical practitioners in hospitals.  American Vanessa O'Rourke, 31, claimed to be a doctor who was suffering from brain cancer. She has been allowed to stay in the community after winning an appeal The American national had come to Australia on a visitor visa in 2016 before returning a year later and staying illegally.  She claimed she was a formally trained doctor and that she had undergone her studies at Temple University in Pennsylvania to become a brain surgeon. So brazen was the con woman that she would refer to herself as 'Doctor' both verbally and in written communications.  But over time her employer noticed O'Rourke displayed a lack of medical knowledge that one might expect from a trained doctor.  She was questioned by bosses but told them she was suffering from brain cancer and that her treatments left her with some short-term memory loss that affected her medical knowledge recall. By April 2017, Queensland police had closed in after receiving a tip-off from US authorities that O'Rourke was a fraud.  She had fled the US while wanted for unrelated theft offences. When a US court tracked her down, O'Rourke sent a fax from a QLD resort under the guise of a surgeon advising she was required to stay in Australia for another five months to receive cancer treatment. Belle Gibson arrives at the Federal Court in Melbourne last month. The cancer con artist was facing court over failure to pay a $410,000 penalty she got for duping Australians When questioned by Queensland police, O'Rourke claimed she had been set up by her family and friends 'who had their own agenda'. The AAT heard O'Rourke admitted that she had forged the letter in an attempt to avoid returning to the US but not because she was scared to face justice.  Her ex-partner - a US police officer - had organised for O'Rourke to be fraudulently charged with offences she did not commit, she claimed.  The tribunal further heard a GoFundMe page had been established in the US to raise money for O'Rourke's bogus cancer treatment.  Hanna Dickenson faked having terminal cancer before scamming money from friends of her family. She was jailed for three months The page claimed she had been studying at Temple University to become a brain surgeon when she was diagnosed with brain cancer.  An article on a US website indicated that O'Rourke had to travel to Australia for a new type of treatment which was unavailable in the US. While the first round of treatment had been successful, she reportedly needed to pay for the second round of treatment  A benefit dinner was even held to raise money with the GoFundMe page collecting about $10,000 towards a goal of $65,000. O'Rourke told the tribunal the page must have been set up by her ex-partner to benefit himself and she had not been convicted of the alleged crime.  She also ripped off a pool manufacturer and electrical goods shop.  Alysha Rose Goring ripped off friends and family by pretending to have brain cancer. She was jailed last month but released on appeal bail O'Rourke pleaded guilty at the Maroochydore Magistrates' Court in 2017 to two counts of forgery and uttering, fraud in which she gained benefit or advantage as an employee, two counts of uttering a forged document, and two counts of fraud where she dishonestly caused detriment.  The appeals tribunal heard O'Rourke now took full responsibility for being dishonest in the past and that she would never commit any offence again in the future.  Under the guidelines for Australia's character test, a person will be taken to have a substantial criminal record, and thus fail the test, if she has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more.  She was then taken into immigration detention in August last year after unsuccessfully applying for partner visa, which has now been resubmitted.  The Cairns man told the tribunal O'Rourke had struggled in immigration detention, complaining she went from being a happy and energetic person to being miserable, vulnerable and anxious.  In sending O'Rourke's bridging visa application back to the immigration minister, the tribunal stated that 'the very low risk that the Applicant presents to the Australian community is acceptable in this case'. ","<h2>EXCLUSIVE: Australia, the home of cancer fakers: American fraudster who pretended to be a BRAIN surgeon suffering from killer disease is allowed to stay down under</h2>"

He had been accused of running a vast trafficking network, with branches in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Europe. Italy, Sudan and Britain at the time hailed his capture as the stellar result of a joint operation which had dealt a significant blow to the people smuggling business. Claims of mistaken identity came after Italian authorities announced the arrest, and images of the man they said was Mered were published in international media The images broadcast by Italian police of a thin young man with frizzy hair, looking frail as he walked off the plane in handcuffs, sparked confusion and disbelief within the Eritrean diaspora around the world  Friends of Kidane (pictured) also pointed out that photos of him bore no resemblance to photographs of Mered  Despite differences in appearance between the two men, and DNA evidence supporting Berhe's case, Italian prosecutors stuck to their guns throughout and had called for a 14-year jail sentence. On Friday, they said they would wait for the court's reasoning to be published before deciding whether to appeal.  Mered ended up on an international wanted list after being identified as the man who organised the packing of migrants onto a boat that sank off Italy in October 2013, killing at least 360 people in one of the worst such disasters in the Mediterranean. The 'cynical and unscrupulous' Mered had been 'continuously and constantly reaping vast profits while showing a contempt for human life,' according to a joint statement by Sudan, Italy and Britain announcing his arrest in May 2016. But the images broadcast by Italian police of a thin young man with frizzy hair, looking frail as he walked off the plane in handcuffs, sparked confusion and disbelief within the Eritrean diaspora around the world. Migrants wait at a fishing port in the Libyan city of Tripoli after being caught trying to board boats headed for Europe in 2016 The number of migrant crossings has since risen above 600,000, but the flows into Italy have slowed dramatically over the past two years  Those who had had dealings with Mered said it was not him. Berhe's family recognised him instantly. According to American, Italian and Swedish investigative journalists, Mered spent part of 2016 in prison in Dubai for using a false passport and now lives in Uganda. DNA evidence also suggested the wrong man was behind bars: tests on Behre's mother showed the defendant was her son. Further tests, on Mered's three-year-old son, who lives in Sweden, showed the defendant was not his father. A New Yorker investigative reporter was told by 'the General' himself in 2017 that the Italians had the wrong man. 'They should just have said 'we made a mistake',' lawyer Michele Calantropo told AFP on Thursday head of the verdict. Calantropo insisted that the man behind bars has only one thing in common with the trafficker: his first name, Medhanie. 'This is one of the biggest injustices on the face of the earth,' he said. Medhanie was the name flagged by Britain's National Crime Agency in 2016 when it heard someone going by that name calling the tapped phone of a suspected smuggler in Libya. The man who made the calls was tracked down and arrested in Khartoum. But while prosecutors said the calls were made to organise migrant trips, Calantropo said his client was just looking out for loved ones heading to Europe.      ",<h2>Eritrean on trial in Italy accused of being human trafficking kingpin named 'the General' is cleared after 21 months as court agrees carpenter's claim of mistaken identity</h2>

Department for Education figures published yesterday predict the secondary school population will hit 3.3million by 2027 – a rise of 14.7 per cent. It follows a baby boom in the early 2000s partly driven by an increase in immigration, which has put pressure on primary places for years and will now feed through secondaries.

The DfE document states direct immigration of pupils born outside the UK ‘has a very small effect on the school age population’, but adds: ‘The birth rate, which has a much larger effect, is in turn affected by any increase in the number of children born to non-UK born women (who overall tend to have higher fertility rates).’ It adds: ‘The number of children born to non-UK born women rose by around 75 per cent between 2002 and 2013, although this was a period of increased births generally.’","<h2>Secondary schools face 420,000 rise in pupil numbers following baby boom in the 2000s that was partly driven by high immigration</h2>"

Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said on 'Fox & Friends': 'You know it's politics when the Democrats had to take down a tweet.'

The latest twice-yearly 'Religion Monitor' poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that 50 per cent of those interviewed were suspicious of the religion, Bild reported. But only 13 per cent of respondants wanted immigration halted, the foundation's religion expert Yasemin El-Menouar was keen to point out. Members of the Identitarian Movement protest on the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, with a banner reading 'secure borders - secure future' in August 2016 'Widespread scepticism of Islam' did 'not necessarily equate to Islamophobia,' she said. 'Apparently, many people currently view Islam less as a religion, but above all as a political ideology and therefore exempt it from religious tolerance,' El-Menouar said. Some 5 million Muslims live in Germany - 1.5 million of them in the western state of  North Rhine-Westphalia. In eastern Germany, where fewer Muslims live, attitudes were more negative. Some 57 per cent of easteners saw Islam as a threat, compared to 50 per cent in the west. And 30 per cent of those in the east went as far as to say they did not want a Muslim for a neighbour, as opposed to 16 per cent in the west.  An East German Trabant car with a sticker showing Eurosceptic, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party (AfD) candidate for Goerlitz mayor Sebastian Wippel While the study's authors expressed concern about its findings, attitudes towards Muslims do not seem to be hardening over time.  The April 2013 Religion Monitor report found that 51 per cent of Germans saw Islam as a threat.

As first reported by the New York Times, the controversial raids will conducted over a number of days commencing the morning of July 14, which will include ‘collateral’ deportations according to two anonymous ICE officials. Officers have been instructed to detain immigrants who happen to be in the vicinity of the raid, even if they weren’t the intended target of it, the officials said. Family members who are arrested together will be held in family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, but space limitations mean that some will be held up in hotels until proper travel documents can be prepared. Immigration Customs and Border Patrol officers will start conducting raids all over the country on Sunday in a bid to arrest thousands of members of undocumented families The aim of the raids is to deport the families as quickly as possible, the sources told the outlet. ICE are believed to be targeting 2,000 immigrants across 10 major cities who’re residing in the country illegally after ignoring deportation orders. The targeted family are believed to be those who crossed the US-Mexico border as recently as last fall. ICE issued the families notice to report to their nearest immigration office and leave the United States, according to the sources. The immigration outfit have thus far refused to comment on the specific details of the operation to ensure the safety of agency personnel. ICE are believed to be targeting 2,000 immigrants across 10 major cities who’re residing in the country illegally after ignoring deportation orders Trump’s Administration is homing the scheme harsh display of force will deter other migrant families from attempting to cross of the US-Mexico divide The slated raids have sparked fearsome debate inside the Department of Homeland security, outraged politicians across the bi-partisan divide and has rattled immigrant communities over the past few weeks. Trump’s Administration is homing the scheme harsh display of force will deter other migrant families from attempting to cross of the US-Mexico divide. Agents of the government body are said to have expressed concerns to their superiors about arresting babies and other young children. They’re also said to be apprehensive about how effective the tactic might be, considering now that tips on how to avoid arrest have already spread to various immigrant communities. For instance, ICE agents are not allowed to force entry into someone’s home, so if they don’t answer, they won’t be confronted. Over the last few months the raids have been touted several times, with ICE’s former director Mark Morgan signalling that agents were gearing up to round up illegal families. The claim was made days before the then-secret scheme was set to begin, however a tweet from the President announcing plan blind-sided Morgan, forcing him to call it off. He said he believed the safety of his border agents would’ve been compromised had he continued with the plans. Acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, then told Morgan in June to call off the operation entirely. He said he didn’t support the raids, citing concerns over undocumented parents being separated from the children who are legal American citizens. Officials from Homeland Security also said they feared that many of the families that ICE had hoped to detain may have actually left their listed address after Trump’s tweet, which could lead to false arrests. The aim of the raids is to deport the families from the US as quickly as possible (pictured: An immigrant family is detained by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials after crossing illegally into the United States on July 9) Branding the proposed operation ‘heartless’, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump urging him to cease the plans. Trump later tweeted that he would delay the efforts, but also threatened to resume with mass deportations if Democrats refused to acquiesce with Republican lawmakers to work out a solution form ‘asylum and loophole’ reform at the Southern Border. 'The Democrats it seems to me they want to have open borders,' Trump said at the time. ‘Unless we do something pretty miraculous [in striking a deal]... we will be removing large numbers of people starting in a week after, you know, sometime after July 4,' he added. In the days that followed the Senate passed a $4.6 billion humanitarian bill to provide aid to the border. Officers have been instructed to detain immigrants who happen to be in the vicinity of the raid, even if they weren’t the intended target of it, officials said Trump expressed his gratitude to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for helping to pass the bill. She backed down from an effort to alter the legislation, saying instead that the House would ‘reluctantly’ take up the Senate bill ‘to get resources to the children fastest.’ ‘We did get in a very bipartisan way, and I appreciate Speaker Pelosi because she really worked with us. It was humanitarian money,’ Trump said in praise. Migrant crossings have seen a sharp decline since May, a month that saw a 13-year-high in attempted crossing, with more than 144,000 migrants taken into custody. However, the president added that the bill’s signing didn’t make the raids any less likely. ‘I say they came in illegally, and we’re bringing them out legally,’ Trump declared.","<h2>ICE raids to 'deport 2,000 immigrants' will be begin on SUNDAY: Trump-backed operation will be carried out over multiple days in 10 major cities, Homeland Security officials warn</h2>"
